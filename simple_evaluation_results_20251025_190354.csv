This change allows for more flexibility in determining loan periods for students who may have unique circumstances.

2. **Expanded Guidance on Post-Death Disbursements**: The revisions also provide expanded guidance regarding disbursements that occur after the death of a borrower, ensuring that there are clear protocols in place for handling such sensitive situations.

3. **General Updates**: While the chapter includes these specific changes, it is noted that there are no significant reorganizations or major overhauls to the content. The updates primarily consist of clarifications and adjustments to existing guidance.

These revisions aim to enhance clarity and provide more comprehensive support for students and institutions navigating the Direct Loan program and related processes.
