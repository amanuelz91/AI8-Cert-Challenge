What are the eligibility requirements and limitations for parents seeking Direct PLUS Loans under Title IV to support their dependent undergraduate students' education costs?,"['information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07. Direct Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form If you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information sections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the student, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up to the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent second-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume for information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of the other Title IV programs. Self-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or have refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated statement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students without parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide. Direct PLUS Loans Direct PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate students. A parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who meets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a student. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent who had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements outlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal government holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s ineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student is otherwise eligible. Requirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers Schools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan Program and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available to both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit Direct PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students.

However, the school must not make any subsequent disbursements of the loan unless the student resumes enrollment on at least a half-time basis during the payment period. A student who is no longer enrolled at least half time may not receive as a late disbursement any second or subsequent disbursement of the loan. Note that different requirements apply if a student who received a Direct Loan disbursement prior to the first day of classes fails to begin attendance in any classes. See <When A Student Fails to Begin Attendance= in Volume 4, Chapter 3. If a student does not withdraw but ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a school may make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred by the student for a period in which the student was eligible. However, this does not apply if the student dropped all future classes or modules, because the student never began classes as a half-time student. Title IV program funds (including Direct Loans) are disbursed to a student on the presumption that the student will attend the hours for which aid has been awarded. Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of a Direct Loan until a student has begun attendance in enough hours to establish half-time enrollment status. However, if a school has not yet made a Direct Loan disbursement to a student who has dropped classes, and the school determines that the student never began attendance in enough classes to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan to that student. Likewise, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules drops all future classes before beginning attendance in enough modules to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan because the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis.

How do the Cost of Attendance (COA) and Allowable Costs influence the determination of financial aid for students under Title IV programs?,"['<1-hop>\n\nChapter 2 Cost of Attendance (Budget) Awards for most of the Title IV programs are based on some form of financial need. Unlike scholarship programs that may award funds based on academic merit or the student9s field of study, <need-based= grants, loans, and work-study are based on the student9s demonstrated financial need for assistance. The cost of attendance (COA) is the cornerstone of establishing a student9s financial need, as it sets a limit on the total aid that a student may receive for purposes of the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, and is one of the basic components of the Pell Grant calculation. This chapter picks up at the point where the Student Aid Index (SAI) for a student has been determined. See Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide for more information on the SAI, and Volume 1 for more information on basic student eligibility requirements. Most schools establish average costs for different categories of students and set these cost categories in EDExpress or other software that they use to determine awards and package aid. The typical costs that you establish for your students will be used to calculate their Title IV award amounts and package their aid.', '<2-hop>\n\nAllowable Costs The HEA specifies the types of costs that are included in the COA, but each school must determine the appropriate and reasonable amounts to include for each eligible COA category for its students, based on the criteria described in this chapter. The COA for a student is an estimate of that student9s educational expenses for the period of enrollment. As you9ll see, in most cases you can use average expenses (for students with the same enrollment status) at your school, rather than actual expenses. For example, for the tuition and fees component, you can use the same average amount for all full-time students instead of figuring the actual tuition and fees for each individual student. You can have different standard costs for different categories of students, such as one COA for out-of-state students, who are charged higher tuition, and a different COA for in-state students, who are charged lower tuition. However, you cannot combine the COA figures for each separate enrollment status and award aid to a student based on the average COA. Students must be awarded based on a COA comprised of allowable costs assessed all students carrying the same academic workload. If a student is enrolled in a program that has extra fees or costs, such as lab fees, you can add those fees to the student9s cost or use a standard cost that you9ve established for all students in that program. If you establish standard cost categories, you must apply the cost allowances uniformly to all students in those categories. There are a variety of methods to arrive at average costs for your students, such as conducting periodic surveys of your student population, assessing local housing costs or other pertinent data, or other reasonable methods you may devise which generate accurate average costs for various categories of students. The types of costs that may be included are the same for all Title IV programs. For the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, the COA, based on the student9s enrollment status, is a student9s cost for the period for which the aid is intended. For Pell Grants, the COA is always the full-year costs for a full-time student, so you may have to prorate actual or average costs up for students who are attending less than an academic year (or who are less than full time in a term-based program) or prorate down for students who are attending for periods longer than an academic year. Note that though certain components are excluded from the Pell Grant COA for a student who is enrolled on a less-than-half-time basis, the components that are included in the less-than-half-time Pell Grant COA are still based on the full-year costs for a full-time student for a Pell Grant recipient with an enrollment intensity below 50%. See Volume 7 for guidance on Pell Grant requirements. The types of costs included in the COA are determined by section 472 of the HEA and are the only costs that may be included in a student9s COA. If a cost is not listed below, it may not be included as part of the COA. Unless it is specifically noted in the discussion of COA categories below that a particular category applies only to students who are enrolled at least half time, the types of expenses that may be included in the COA are the same for all students, regardless of enrollment status.']","The Cost of Attendance (COA) is crucial in determining a student's financial need for Title IV programs, as it sets a limit on the total aid a student may receive. The COA includes various allowable costs, which are specified by the Higher Education Act (HEA) and must be determined by each school based on reasonable amounts for eligible categories. These costs are used to calculate Title IV award amounts and package aid. Schools can use average expenses for students with the same enrollment status, but must ensure that the COA is comprised of allowable costs for all students carrying the same academic workload. This ensures that financial aid is awarded based on a consistent and fair assessment of educational expenses.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
How does a student's loan eligibility change when transferring to a new school with an abbreviated loan period within the same academic year?,"['<1-hop>\n\nyear, the student9s loan eligibility for the remaining term(s) of the academic year is equal to the difference between the applicable loan limit for the new program and the loan amount the student received for the prior program within the same academic year. Transfer Into a Clock-Hour, Non-Term, or Non-SE9W Nonstandard Term Program (BBAY 3): Abbreviated Loan Periods Transfers Between Schools If a student transfers into a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program at a new school and the academic year associated with the last loan the student received at the prior school overlaps the initial academic year for the program at the new school, the new school may originate an initial loan for a loan period that covers the remaining portion of the academic year that began at the prior school. The loan period for this initial loan is called an <abbreviated loan period= because it is shorter than the loan period that would otherwise be required under the normal minimum loan period requirements. As explained earlier in this volume, under normal rules the minimum loan period for a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is the lesser of: The academic year; or The length of the program or the remaining portion of the program. The new school may originate a loan for an abbreviated loan period regardless of whether the new school accepts transfer hours from the prior school. The abbreviated loan period begins with the date of the student9s enrollment at the new school and ends on the calendar period ending date of the academic year that began at the prior school, without regard to the number of credit or clock hours or weeks of instructional time that the student has completed during the abbreviated loan period. After the abbreviated loan period is completed, the student progresses to a new loan period and academic year (BBAY 3) and a new annual loan limit. If the new school accepts credits or hours from the prior school, this may give the student advance standing that reduces the length of time it will take to complete the program at the new school. If the remaining portion of the program at the new school following the completion of the abbreviated loan period is shorter than an academic year, the annual loan limit for the next loan must be prorated. Generally, the loan amount for the abbreviated loan period at the new school may not exceed the remaining balance of the full annual loan limit applicable to the student at the new school, minus the loan amount the student received at the first school for the same academic year. However, there is an exception to this general rule if: The student is transferring into a program at the new school that is less than a full academic year in length; or The student is transferring into a remaining portion of a program (of any length) that is less than an academic year in length. In the two circumstances described above, the total loan amount that the student may receive for the program (or remaining portion of the program) at the new school (for the abbreviated loan period and any subsequent loan period combined) may not exceed the applicable prorated annual loan limit for the program or remaining portion of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nRules for Abbreviated Loan Periods: The abbreviated loan period begins when the student starts at the new school. The abbreviated loan period ends when the academic year would have ended at the prior school, without regard to how many hours or weeks of instructional time the student has completed at the new school during the abbreviated loan period. Generally, the maximum loan amount that the student can receive for the abbreviated loan period is the difference between the full annual loan limit applicable to the student at the new school and the loan amount that was disbursed at the prior school during the overlapping academic year (see the preceding discussion for an exception to this general rule). The first disbursement of the loan for the abbreviated loan period at the new school is made at the beginning of the abbreviated loan period. Unless the school qualifies based on its cohort default rate for the exemption from the multiple disbursement requirement (see Volume 3, Chapter 1), the loan must be disbursed in at least two', '<3-hop>\n\nperiod are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and spring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be enrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering the fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s COA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a school initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of at least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily drops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not required to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school to adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and spring quarters only. In the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring- only loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring loan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would then be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining the student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods Other Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a student9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs associated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the fall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months. The limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last terms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period. For instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall term or the spring term.

How do Pell Grant COA calculations for summer terms relate to Direct Loan periods with clinical work exceptions?,"['<1-hop>\n\nPell Grant COA for Summer Terms Costs used to determine Pell Grant eligibility for summer terms are figured in the same way as for any other payment period; that is, the costs are based on the costs for a full-time student for a full academic year. If your school has fall and spring semesters that comprise an academic year, you can9t add the costs for the summer term to the costs for the fall and spring semesters. The award for the summer term is still based on the costs for one academic year. However, if the academic year definition includes the summer term, then the costs for the summer term must be included in the cost for a full academic year. If the student was previously enrolled in the award year, you may be able to use the same Pell Grant COA for the summer term that you used for the immediately preceding term that the student attended. However, this isn9t possible if the costs are different from the fall through spring, such as a different tuition charge per credit hour, or if you are required to recalculate the Pell Grant COA. If it9s necessary to base the student9s Pell Grant COA on the summer term, you must prorate the summer costs to the length of an academic year to establish the cost for a full academic year. See Chapter 3 of this volume for additional information on prorating costs in the Pell Grant program. If the summer session is the first term in the award year for that student (for example, your school is paying a student for the summer 2025 term from the 2025-26 award year), you must establish the student9s full-year cost based on the costs for the summer term. If the student enrolls in another term in that award year, you may have to recalculate the student9s costs for the later term. Receiving Less Than the Scheduled Award Due to Crossover A student may also receive less than a Scheduled Award in an award year if the student9s program crosses award years and the student9s Pell Grant award in one of the award years is for a portion of the program that is less than a full academic year. For example, if a student9s last term of enrollment to complete their academic program is summer 2025, and the school treats the payment period as a header to the 2025-26 academic year, the student may receive a Pell Grant disbursement for that one payment period, which will be less than the student9s full Scheduled Award for 2025-26. Crossover Pell and Withdrawal For details on how to perform Return of Title IV Funds calculations in a crossover Pell situation, see Volume 5, Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook. Summer Modules If a term-based school offers a series of modules that overlap two award years, these modules may be combined and treated as one term. Schools are not required to combine modules. However, if you do not combine the modules to create a single term and the modules overlap, the program must be considered a non-term program. When you combine modules into a single term (i.e., payment period), the weeks of instructional time in the combined term are the weeks of instructional time from the beginning of the first module to the date the last module ends. The student9s enrollment intensity for the entire payment period must be calculated based on the total number of credits the student is projected to take for all modules. You must project the enrollment intensity for a student based on the credits the student has: Pre-registered or registered to take for all modules; Committed to take for all modules in an academic plan or enrollment contract; or Committed to take for all modules in some other document.', '<2-hop>\n\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and nonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","Pell Grant COA calculations for summer terms are based on the costs for a full academic year, and if the summer term is included in the academic year definition, its costs must be prorated to establish the full-year cost. This is similar to Direct Loan periods with clinical work exceptions, where the loan period start and end dates are adjusted based on the clinical work schedule, affecting the academic year period and payment period dates. Both scenarios require adjustments to standard calculations to accommodate specific term structures, such as summer terms for Pell Grants and clinical work for Direct Loans.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does the FSA Handbook guide schools on handling interim disbursements and Pell Grant COA for summer terms?,"[""<1-hop>\n\nreimburse the appropriate program by the earlier of 60 days after the student9s last day of attendance or the last day of the award year. If your school permits provisional FWS employment of students for up to 60 days prior to verification, your school is liable for any overpayment it can9t recover by adjusting other aid, and it must reimburse the FWS account from its own funds. Students must be paid for all work performed out of your school9s payroll account4they can9t be required to repay FWS wages earned except when they are proven guilty of fraud. Because the school made interim disbursements at its discretion, the school is ultimately responsible for repaying any overpayment. Therefore, in this situation, a student does not owe a Title IV overpayment and the school must not report an overpayment to NSLDS or refer it to the Department for collection. If you make an interim disbursement after completing verification but prior to receiving a correct valid FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR, and you fail to receive the FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR within the deadlines discussed later in this chapter, your school must use its own funds to reimburse the appropriate program and pay the student under your own payroll account for all work performed. Schools that Can9t Make Interim Disbursements Schools on the Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 (HCM2) and Reimbursement payment methods (see Volume 4, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook) must, as part of their request for Title IV funds from the Department, submit documentation showing that students were eligible to receive the funds disbursed to them (and for which the schools are seeking reimbursement). Because final determination of student eligibility includes completing verification, HCM2 and reimbursement schools may not make interim disbursements. Updating Information Generally, a student cannot update information that was correct as of the date the application was signed because the FAFSA form is a <snapshot= of the family9s financial situation as of that date. For example, if the student9s family sold some stock after the student signed the FAFSA form and spent the money on an unreported asset such as a car, they cannot update their information to show a change in assets. After the FAFSA form is signed, only certain items can be updated under the following conditions: All applicants whose dependency status changes must update that and the related FAFSA information throughout the award year except when the update is due to the student9s marital status changing. All applicants selected by the Department or a school for verification of family size must update family size to be correct as of the date of verification unless the update is due to a change in the student9s marital status. Applicants selected for verification are not required to document family size in a subsequent verification in the same year if the information has not changed. At your discretion you may update either dependency status or family size, even if the update is due to a change in the student9s marital status, if you deem it necessary to address an inequity or to reflect more accurately the student's ability to pay. Such a decision must be on a case-by-case basis, and you must document your reasons for it. You must also update all other pertinent information, such as spousal income and taxes paid, to be consistent with the new marital status. If you change the student's status to unmarried and that makes them dependent (because they were independent only due to marriage), the student9s FAFSA form must be updated with their parents9 information. If the student is selected for verification, update the application first, then complete verification of the updated application. Your school may have a policy of not considering such updates after a specific census date."", '<2-hop>\n\nPell Grant COA for Summer Terms Costs used to determine Pell Grant eligibility for summer terms are figured in the same way as for any other payment period; that is, the costs are based on the costs for a full-time student for a full academic year.

How do Direct Loans interact with other financial assistance when considering educational financing options?,"['<1-hop>\n\nMinimum Loan Period: Programs Offered in Modules If a program is offered in modules, this does not change the minimum loan period rules for Direct Loans. For example, if a standard or SE9W nonstandard term is divided into two or more modules, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is still the term, even if the student does not attend all modules within the term. Similarly, if a clock-hour, non-term credit- Minimum Loan Period 34 CFR 685.301(a)(10)(i)', '<2-hop>\n\nOther Financial Assistance (OFA) In contrast to Pell Grants, you must take other aid into account when awarding TEACH Grants, Campus-Based aid, or Direct Loans. As noted earlier, the other aid that must be considered is called <other financial assistance= (OFA). OFA is generally used in the same way for the Direct Loan Program as for the TEACH Grant and Campus-Based programs. However, there are differences in the treatment of AmeriCorps benefits, as discussed later in this chapter. In general, OFA as defined for the Direct Loan, Campus-Based, and TEACH Grant programs refers to aid from the Title IV programs, as well as other grants, scholarships, loans, and wages from need-based employment that you can reasonably anticipate at the time you award aid to the student, whether the assistance is awarded by the school or by an individual or organization outside the school. If aid is excluded from either OFA or COA, that amount must be excluded from both OFA and COA. For Direct Loans, the regulations specify that OFA is aid that the student will receive for the same period of enrollment as the loan. As noted in Chapter 1, it9s usually best to originate a loan for a period that matches the academic year or other period that you9re using to award funds from other Title IV programs. The amount of a private education loan which exceeds the SAI when substituting for the SAI is considered OFA. When classifying non-Title IV sources of aid, if a student receives the award because of postsecondary enrollment (for example, a scholarship from a local social club that requires a student to be attending a postsecondary school), it counts as OFA if it is not considered wages for employment according to federal or state rules, or if it is considered wages and is based on need. Any amount that appears as income on the tax return will also be included on the appropriate line on the FAFSA form in the section for student income. If the award is considered wages for employment but is not based on need, then it is not OFA and it remains in income. Compensation that a student athlete receives under a name, image, and likeness (NIL) contract is a non-need-based source of income and therefore is not considered OFA. Table 1 at the end of this section provides examples of what is and is not considered OFA. student is $9,500 (maximum $3,500 subsidized). The student can also receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in the amount of $2,050 to replace the SAI and fully cover the COA: $9,000 COA - $5,450 Pell - $1,000 FSEOG - $500 Direct Subsidized Loan = $2,050 Direct Unsubsidized Loan eligibility The aid package now fully covers the student9s COA: $9,000 COA - $5,450 Pell - $1,000 FSEOG - $500 Direct Subsidized Loan - $2,050 Direct Unsubsidized Loan = $0 unmet cost *The $5,450 Pell Grant amount shown in this example is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent the actual Pell Grant amount that a student would be eligible to receive.
