Direct Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form If you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information sections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the student, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up to the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent second-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume for information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of the other Title IV programs. Self-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or have refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated statement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students without parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide. Direct PLUS Loans Direct PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate students. A parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who meets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a student. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent who had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements outlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal government holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s ineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student is otherwise eligible. Requirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers Schools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan Program and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available to both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students.

However, the school must not make any subsequent disbursements of the loan unless the student resumes enrollment on at least a half-time basis during the payment period. A student who is no longer enrolled at least half time may not receive as a late disbursement any second or subsequent disbursement of the loan. Note that different requirements apply if a student who received a Direct Loan disbursement prior to the first day of classes fails to begin attendance in any classes. See <When A Student Fails to Begin Attendance= in Volume 4, Chapter 3. If a student does not withdraw but ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a school may make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred by the student for a period in which the student was eligible. However, this does not apply if the student dropped all future classes or modules, because the student never began classes as a half-time student. Title IV program funds (including Direct Loans) are disbursed to a student on the presumption that the student will attend the hours for which aid has been awarded. Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of a Direct Loan until a student has begun attendance in enough hours to establish half-time enrollment status. However, if a school has not yet made a Direct Loan disbursement to a student who has dropped classes, and the school determines that the student never began attendance in enough classes to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan to that student. Likewise, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules drops all future classes before beginning attendance in enough modules to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan because the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis.

Transfer Into a Clock-Hour, Non-Term, or Non-SE9W Nonstandard Term Program (BBAY 3): Abbreviated Loan Periods Transfers Between Schools If a student transfers into a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program at a new school and the academic year associated with the last loan the student received at the prior school overlaps the initial academic year for the program at the new school, the new school may originate an initial loan for a loan period that covers the remaining portion of the academic year that began at the prior school. The loan period for this initial loan is called an <abbreviated loan period= because it is shorter than the loan period that would otherwise be required under the normal minimum loan period requirements. As explained earlier in this volume, under normal rules the minimum loan period for a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is the lesser of: The academic year; or The length of the program or the remaining portion of the program. The new school may originate a loan for an abbreviated loan period regardless of whether the new school accepts transfer hours from the prior school. The abbreviated loan period begins with the date of the student9s enrollment at the new school and ends on the calendar period ending date of the academic year that began at the prior school, without regard to the number of credit or clock hours or weeks of instructional time that the student has completed during the abbreviated loan period. After the abbreviated loan period is completed, the student progresses to a new loan period and academic year (BBAY 3) and a new annual loan limit. If the new school accepts credits or hours from the prior school, this may give the student advance standing that reduces the length of time it will take to complete the program at the new school. If the remaining portion of the program at the new school following the completion of the abbreviated loan period is shorter than an academic year, the annual loan limit for the next loan must be prorated. Generally, the loan amount for the abbreviated loan period at the new school may not exceed the remaining balance of the full annual loan limit applicable to the student at the new school, minus the loan amount the student received at the first school for the same academic year. However, there is an exception to this general rule if: The student is transferring into a program at the new school that is less than a full academic year in length; or The student is transferring into a remaining portion of a program (of any length) that is less than an academic year in length. In the two circumstances described above, the total loan amount that the student may receive for the program (or remaining portion of the program) at the new school (for the abbreviated loan period and any subsequent loan period combined) may not exceed the applicable prorated annual loan limit for the program or remaining portion of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nMinimum Loan Period: Programs Offered in Modules If a program is offered in modules, this does not change the minimum loan period rules for Direct Loans.

How do credit or clock hours affect the disbursement timing of Direct Loans in non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs?,"['<1-hop>\n\nboth the credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","In non-term credit-hour programs, the disbursement of Direct Loans is influenced by the completion of credit or clock hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period.

"How does the verification process for financial aid change following disasters, and what role does income verification play in this context?","['<1-hop>\n\nVerification Following Disasters The Dear Colleague Letter GEN-17-08 gives general guidance for awarding aid in federally declared disasters. It states that the Secretary will not enforce the verification requirements during the award year for applicants whose records were lost or destroyed because of a disaster if the school has tried to preserve and reconstruct any records. The school must document when it does not perform verification for this reason and use status code <S= when reporting the disbursement of Pell Grants to affected students. Also, the requirement for dependent students to submit a statement signed by a parent regarding family size is waived if the parents cannot provide the signature due to the disaster. The school must note why no parent was able to provide the statement. Schools that experience a local disaster (rather than a federally declared one) that affects Title IV administration should consult their regional school participation division. Acceptable Documentation The FAFSA Simplification Act requires that, wherever possible, the Department use data received directly from the IRS to calculate a student9s SAI and Pell Grant award. The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act (FUTURE Act) requires the Department of Education to access tax information held by the IRS pertaining to FAFSA applicants4and, where applicable, their parents and spouses4through a secure method: the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX). The FUTURE Act amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to mandate the disclosure of FTI directly from the IRS to the Department with an individual9s consent and approval. The FUTURE Act also made providing consent and approval for the exchange of FTI a requirement for receiving federal student aid. Applicants and contributors will be required to provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI directly from the IRS. When FTI is received from the IRS via the FA-DDX, the FTI received is considered verified and no additional documentation is necessary. As a result, the FA-DDX is the fastest, easiest, and most secure method of meeting income and tax verification requirements. The September 4, 2024 Federal Register Notice gives the documentation required for verifying 2025-26 application data, which depends on the item verified, as explained in this section. If you use a verification document, be sure that it is signed, that all required sections are completed, and that any relevant tax or alternative documents are attached. Copies of original documents are acceptable. An original signature on an original document, an original signature on a copy of a document, and a copy of a document with an original signature on it are all valid signatures, unless specifically noted in this chapter. If a copy of the tax return is used, the filer (or at least one of the filers of a joint return) must sign it or the tax preparer must provide their name and SSN, EIN, or PTIN. Suggested Verification Text The Department has developed suggested text that you may use to create a verification document and to verify non-tax items, such as family size. To review the suggested text for 2025-26, please see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10. The suggested text fulfills verification requirements, but schools do not have to use it, except as noted below. Instead, they may develop and use their own (or someone else9s) text, forms, documents, statements, and certifications that are specific to the items required to be verified for a particular student or group of students at the school. However, schools they tried to locate their estranged spouse. The school determines that the student doesn9t need to verify their spouse9s tax and income information.

Family Size Since family size is based on the number of individuals listed and claimed on the IRS tax return, if transferred directly from the IRS and used, family size does not need to be verified. However, when information is not transferred from the IRS, or if the applicant updated their family size when presented with the opportunity to do so on their FAFSA, the following documentation is sufficient for verification: A statement signed by the applicant and, if the applicant is a dependent student, by one of the applicant's parents, that lists the name and age of each family member for the 2025326 award year and the relationship of that family member to the applicant. For a dependent student, you don9t have to verify family size in the following situations: The family size is reported as two with a single, divorced, separated, or widowed parent; or The family size is reported as three with parents who are married or are unmarried and living together. For an independent student, you don9t have to verify family size in the following situations: The family size is reported as two if the student is married; or The family size is reported as one if the student is single, divorced, separated, or widowed. Additionally, you don9t need to verify family size if the applicant manually updated their family size and the number is the same as the family size derived from data transferred directly from the IRS. Keep in mind that family size needs to align with the answers to the relevant dependency status questions, such as the one about having dependents other than a spouse. If verification reveals that answers do not match, the FAFSA form needs to be corrected so that the information is in alignment. Identity and Statement of Educational Purpose Students should appear in person at your school and present a valid, unexpired, government-issued photo identification (ID) such as a U.S. passport, a driver9s license, or other state-issued ID. <Unexpired= means the ID has not expired at the time it is checked, even if it will expire before the end of the award year. A valid government-issued photo identification is one issued by the U.S. government, any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, a federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native Tribe, American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or the Republic of Palau. You must maintain an annotated copy of that ID that includes the date it was received and the name of the person your school authorized to receive it. Your school may determine which of its staff are authorized to review an applicant9s identity. We recommend that the person(s) be full-time staff and the school keep a record of who they are. The following are not sufficient for identity verification: An ID issued by a state university or college.

A payment period that begins before July 1 and ends on or after July 1 is called a <crossover payment period.= The formula for calculating the payment for a crossover payment period is the same as that for any other payment period in the award year. Crossover Payment From the Proper Award Year For Pell purposes, you must consider a crossover payment period to occur entirely within one award year and calculate the student9s Pell award and disburse Pell funds from the award year selected. If you only have a valid FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR from one award year, you must rely on that record and the award year to which the valid FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR pertains. Aside from these considerations, the decision about which award year to use is based on the student9s remaining eligibility in the earlier award year. This assessment is made according to your school9s payment period policy, which for crossover Pell payment periods may apply to: an individual student; all students or a category of students without exception; or all students or a category of students with allowance for exceptions in the case of individual students. Although you may assign a crossover payment period to either of the relevant award years (subject to the limitations described below), you must make the assignment based on what you determine will be most beneficial to students. You may assign the Pell Grant award to a different award year than the rest of the student9s Title IV aid. You can make a payment for a crossover payment period out of either award year if the student has a valid FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR for the award year selected. You may assign two consecutive crossover payment periods to the same award year. For example, you could treat summer 2025 and summer 2026 as both being in the 2025-26 award year. You may also source the Pell funds from different award years for different students, as their eligibility allows, depending on their remaining eligibility and financial need. You may not make a payment which will result in the student receiving more than their Scheduled Award for an award year, unless the student is eligible for a Year-Round Pell award (see Year-Round Pell Grant section later in this chapter), in which case the student may be eligible to receive up to 150% of their Scheduled Award for the award year.

FAFSA Simplification Act The FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a significant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need analysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the FAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process. Changes From the FUTURE Act The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data exchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate completing the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX eliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information reported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered verified for Title IV purposes. Unlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s spouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via the FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid. Other Changes Throughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references have been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year. Where appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been properly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers.

Additionally, the FAFSA Simplification Act, along with the FUTURE Act, has streamlined the FAFSA application process by implementing the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) with the IRS.

How can Volume 4 and Volume 7 help in managing financial aid for a student's higher education?,"['<1-hop>\n\nChapter 3 Packaging Aid In this chapter we explain how to package a student9s aid once you9ve received the student9s FAFSA form information, including the student aid index (SAI), and have calculated the student9s aid eligibility. The general rule in packaging is that the student9s need-based aid must not exceed the student9s financial need, and total financial aid and other financial assistance (OFA) must not exceed the student9s cost of attendance (COA). If you discover that a student9s aid package exceeds the student9s financial need or COA, you must attempt to adjust the aid package to eliminate the overaward. See Volume 4, Chapter 3 for guidance on handling overawards and overpayments.', '<2-hop>\n\nVolume 7, Chapter 5, Example 3: Modules Treated as Nonstandard Terms If the school didn9t combine these modules and defined full-time enrollment for each 4-week module as fewer than 12 semester hours, it would have to calculate all Pell payments for the program using Formula 3. Because these are nonstandard terms, the school would have to determine the student9s enrollment intensity for each module by prorating the standard for full-time enrollment in a full academic year (24 semester hours): (24 semester hours × 4 weeks in module) ÷ 30 weeks in academic year = 3.2 semester hours (round up to 4 semester hours because the school only offers courses in whole credits) Note: Weeks of instructional time are defined in Volume 3, Chapter 1, which are not necessarily the same number as the calendar weeks in an academic year. For each of the 4-week modules, a full-time student must enroll in 4 semester hours, and based on that standard,']","Volume 4 provides guidance on handling overawards and overpayments in student aid packaging, ensuring that a student's need-based aid does not exceed their financial need or cost of attendance. Volume 7, on the other hand, offers examples of how to calculate Pell payments for programs with nonstandard terms, such as modules, by determining enrollment intensity and prorating the standard for full-time enrollment. Together, these volumes can help manage and adjust financial aid packages effectively to support a student's higher education expenses.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does the FSA Handbook guide schools in handling Direct PLUS Loan funds when a parent borrower dies, and what are the implications for enrollment intensity calculations in direct assessment programs?","['<1-hop>\n\nmay not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of payments while the student was enrolled at least half time. If a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death, the school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent student (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4 of this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.', '<2-hop>\n\nDetermining Enrollment Intensity Using Credit Hour Equivalencies For students enrolled in direct assessment programs and students with intellectual disabilities enrolled in comprehensive transition and postsecondary (CTP) programs, enrollment intensity can be calculated using credit hour <equivalencies= rather than credit hours. For direct assessment programs, schools must develop a methodology, consistent with the requirements of the school9s accrediting agency or state, to reasonably equate each class or competency in the direct assessment program to either credit hour or clock hour equivalencies. For more information, see Volume 2, Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook. Enrollment intensity for students with intellectual disabilities enrolled in CTP programs may also be determined using credit hour equivalencies. These equivalent credits, earned from audited courses and other normally noncredit activities undertaken as part of a program for students with disabilities, may be awarded for purposes of determining enrollment intensity. For more detail, see Volume 1, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook. Enrollment Intensity for Cooperative Education In a cooperative education program, your school assesses the work to be performed by the student and determines the equivalent academic course load. The student9s enrollment intensity is based on the equivalent academic course load. Academic Calendar and Enrollment Intensity Changes Because the academic calendar for a program determines which Pell formula you use, you need to review the conditions for the use of each formula if the calendar for the program changes. This is particularly true if you are using Formulas 1 and 2, which have the most restrictive conditions. If a student9s enrollment intensity changes during the year, your school may have to recalculate the student9s Pell Grant payment based on the new enrollment intensity. We9ll discuss when a school is required to recalculate a student9s Pell Grant payment due to a change in enrollment intensity in Chapter 7 of this volume. Pell Grant Cost of Attendance The types of costs included in the Pell Grant cost of attendance are the same as those for the other Title IV programs; however, the value of each component in the Pell Grant COA is always based on the costs for a full-time student for a full academic year. See Volume 3, Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook for a full discussion of cost of attendance and allowable costs. For Pell, costs for programs or enrollment periods longer or shorter than an academic year must be prorated so that they are the costs for one full academic year. This is true for both parts of the academic year definition: if either the number of weeks or the number of clock/credit hours differs from the academic year standard, the costs must be prorated to determine the full-time, full-year Pell budget. The need to prorate Pell costs is most likely to occur in these situations: A term-based program that provides fewer weeks of instructional time than the minimum number of weeks of instructional time in an academic year; A non-term program that provides less than 24 semester hours, 36 quarter hours, or 900 clock hours and/or provides fewer weeks of instructional time than the minimum number of weeks of instructional time in an academic year; or A program that is longer than an academic year, where the costs for the entire program are charged at the beginning']","The FSA Handbook provides guidance for schools on handling Direct PLUS Loan funds in the event of a parent borrower's death. If a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds disbursed after the parent's death, it should determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student. This guidance is detailed in Appendix B of the FSA Handbook. Additionally, the FSA Handbook outlines how enrollment intensity can be calculated using credit hour equivalencies for students in direct assessment programs. Schools must develop a methodology to equate each class or competency to credit hour or clock hour equivalencies, as per the requirements of the accrediting agency or state.
