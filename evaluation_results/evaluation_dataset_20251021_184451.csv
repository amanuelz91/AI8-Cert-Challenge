What Title IV mean?,"['information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07. Direct Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form If you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information sections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the student, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up to the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent second-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume for information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of the other Title IV programs. Self-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or have refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated statement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students without parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide. Direct PLUS Loans Direct PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate students. A parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who meets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a student. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent who had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements outlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal government holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s ineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student is otherwise eligible. Requirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers Schools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan Program and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available to both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit Direct PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students.

However, the school must not make any subsequent disbursements of the loan unless the student resumes enrollment on at least a half-time basis during the payment period. A student who is no longer enrolled at least half time may not receive as a late disbursement any second or subsequent disbursement of the loan. Note that different requirements apply if a student who received a Direct Loan disbursement prior to the first day of classes fails to begin attendance in any classes. See <When A Student Fails to Begin Attendance= in Volume 4, Chapter 3. If a student does not withdraw but ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a school may make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred by the student for a period in which the student was eligible. However, this does not apply if the student dropped all future classes or modules, because the student never began classes as a half-time student. Title IV program funds (including Direct Loans) are disbursed to a student on the presumption that the student will attend the hours for which aid has been awarded. Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of a Direct Loan until a student has begun attendance in enough hours to establish half-time enrollment status. However, if a school has not yet made a Direct Loan disbursement to a student who has dropped classes, and the school determines that the student never began attendance in enough classes to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan to that student. Likewise, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules drops all future classes before beginning attendance in enough modules to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan because the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis. If a student who dropped to less-than-half-time status resumes enrollment on a half-time basis during the payment period or period of enrollment, the school may make remaining disbursements of a Direct Loan if the school documents (1) the student9s revised COA, and (2) that the student continues to qualify for the entire amount of the loan, despite any reduction in the student9s COA caused by the temporary cessation of enrollment on at least a half-time basis.

"How do crossover periods affect the recalculation of Pell Grants, and what are the implications for students' financial aid packages during these periods?","['<1-hop>\n\nrecalculating Pell Grants and TEACH Grants when a student9s enrollment intensity or status changes within a term or period of enrollment, the policy must be applied consistently to all students. Therefore, if your school chooses to recalculate Pell Grants and TEACH Grants for a student whose enrollment intensity or enrollment status in a program increases (for example, from half-time to full-time), it must also recalculate for a student whose enrollment intensity or status decreases. Once you have recalculated a student9s eligibility, Title IV funds in excess of the amount the student is eligible to receive must be returned or re-awarded, as applicable. For guidance on handling excess cash resulting from recalculations of aid eligibility due to enrollment intensity or status changes, see Volume 4, Chapter 1. Recalculation and Direct Loans If a student9s enrollment status changes after the student has already received one or more Direct Loan disbursements, no recalculation of the previously disbursed Direct Loan amount is required. For information on how changes in enrollment status may affect a student9s eligibility to receive pending Direct Loan disbursements, see Volume 8, Chapter 1. Recalculation and Pell Grants Since Pell Grants are always based on the full-time COA, recalculation means that you are looking at the student9s revised enrollment intensity. For more detail on recalculating Pell Grants, see Volume 7, Chapter 7. Recalculating COA When performing a recalculation a school may not include in the COA costs associated with any classes the student failed to begin. In addition, in determining a student9s COA a school may not include any costs for a period when the student was not enrolled in and attending any Title IV eligible classes (other than costs for a brief period between regularly scheduled terms or semesters). Note that some components of COA are not included if a student is enrolled less than half time (see Chapter 2 of this volume). A school that performs a Return of Title IV Funds calculation on a period of enrollment basis for a student enrolled in a program offered in modules may not include in the recalculated COA any costs associated with a future payment period for which the student has not confirmed attendance at the time of withdrawal and that does not start within 45 days. COA Changes Between or Within Payment Periods A school may have a policy of recalculating awards only when the COA changes from one payment period to the next, and not when the COA changes within a payment period. For example, a school could recalculate awards because of changes to a student9s tuition and fee costs or living situation (e.g., when a student moves off campus) between payment periods. However, schools also have the option to establish a policy of recalculating financial aid awards when a student9s costs change within a payment period. For instance, if a student with no dependents moves from a dormitory to off-campus housing at midterm, a school could choose to recalculate the student9s award for that payment period. For Pell Grant purposes, such a policy is acceptable if it9s carried out for all students whose costs change within the payment period. Note that schools are not limited to one or the other of the policies described above. Schools may have a policy of recalculating awards when there is a change in costs at any time during an award year (whether within a payment period or between payment periods), as long as the recalculation policy is carried out for all students whose costs change. Schools may not recalculate the payment for a payment period that took place before the cost change. For instance, if a student lives in the dormitory during the first quarter and then moves off campus for the second and third quarters, the recalculation would only affect the payments for the second and third quarters.', '<2-hop>\n\nCrossover Periods Crossover periods are payment, award, or loan periods that overlap two award years.

Table 2 at the end of this section summarizes the options for handling crossover payment periods in the Title IV programs.

This selection is crucial as it affects the student's eligibility and the amount of aid they receive. For Pell Grants, the FAFSA Processing System must have processed a valid Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) for the selected award year.

How do credit or clock hours affect disbursement timing for Pell Grants and Direct Loans in different educational programs?,"['<1-hop>\n\nboth the credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","Credit or clock hours play a significant role in determining disbursement timing for Pell Grants and Direct Loans. In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, the disbursement of Pell Grants or TEACH Grants is based on the scheduled payment periods established at the beginning of the program, which do not change regardless of a student's progression rate. However, if a student accelerates and completes additional hours, it may affect their Direct Loan eligibility, potentially requiring proration of the loan limit in the final academic year. In subscription-based programs, students must complete a cumulative number of credit hours equal to those enrolled in previous periods to receive subsequent disbursements of Title IV aid. Additionally, schools can choose to make multiple disbursements within a payment period to better meet students' needs, provided the disbursements are substantially equal.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How do you figure out Pell Grant eligibility for students in correspondence programs, and what are the payment rules?","['<1-hop>\n\nThe cost of attendance (COA) for students engaged in a program of study by correspondence must include tuition and fees and, if required, books, course materials, supplies, and equipment. A school may also include an allowance for travel, housing, and food costs incurred specifically for a period of residential training. The COA must be based on the costs for a full-time student for a full academic year for the relevant component. If the student9s program or period of enrollment, as measured in credit hours, is longer or shorter than an academic year as measured in credit hours, the tuition and fees for the program or enrollment period must be prorated. Because the correspondence study COA for the nonresidential component only includes costs associated with credit hours, your school always uses the credit-hour-related fraction to prorate the COA. (Because there are no costs associated with weeks of instructional time in the correspondence cost of attendance, your school must prorate the cost only if the number of hours in the program is shorter or longer than in an academic year): Credit hours in program9s definition of an academic year ÷ Credit hours to which the costs apply The resulting amount is the full-time, full-academic-year cost used for calculating Pell Grant eligibility. Pell Enrollment Intensity for Correspondence Study Programs Students enrolled in programs of correspondence study are no more than half-time students (the equivalent of 50% enrollment intensity), even if they are enrolled in enough coursework to be full time. However, if the correspondence study is combined with regular coursework, the student9s enrollment intensity might be more than 50%. For a student enrolled in a term-based correspondence program, your school must determine how many credits to include in the numerator of the enrollment intensity formula to determine the student9s annual award. See the <Students taking a combination of regular and correspondence courses= section in Chapter 3 for additional guidance. A student enrolled only in a non-term correspondence program always has their award calculated based on 50% enrollment intensity. Pell Correspondence Payment Periods and Timing of Payments For a non-term correspondence program, there must be two equal payment periods in each academic year. Each payment period is the lesser of half the academic year or half the program (measured in credit hours). In addition, you can9t disburse a Pell payment for the first payment period until the student has completed 25% of the work in the academic year or the program, whichever is shorter. You can9t make the second payment until the student has completed 75% of the work in the academic year or program. For a term-based correspondence program, as for other term-based programs, the payment period is the term. However, you can9t disburse Pell for a payment period until the student has completed 50% of the lessons or completes 50% of the work for the term, whichever is later. If the correspondence program has a required period of residential training, you must treat the residential training as an additional payment period and determine the payment for that payment period using either Formula 3 or Formula 4. Note that the correspondence portion of the program is still treated as a separate portion of the program that9s divided into equal payment periods.', '<2-hop>\n\nPell Calculations in Correspondence Programs Formula 5 is used for students enrolled only in correspondence courses (not including residential components of correspondence programs).

Students in correspondence programs are considered no more than half-time, affecting their enrollment intensity and annual award calculations. For non-term correspondence programs, there are two equal payment periods per academic year, and payments are contingent on the completion of a certain percentage of the program. Specifically, the first payment cannot be disbursed until 25% of the work is completed, and the second payment requires 75% completion.

"How does proration apply to students in clock-hour programs when their remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year, and what are some examples of this proration process?","['<1-hop>\n\nGraduate Early From a Clock-Hour Program= later in this chapter). In a standard-term program, or a credit-hour program using SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of study is considered shorter than an academic year if the remaining period contains fewer terms than the number of terms covered by the school9s Title IV academic year. For programs that are offered in a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY; see Chapter 6), the number of terms covered in the school9s Title IV academic year usually does not include a summer <header= or <trailer= term. Consider a student who is enrolled in a four-year program that is offered in an SAY consisting of three quarters plus a summer trailer, and who has completed four academic years of study. The student needs to attend an additional quarter term to complete the program requirements. The final quarter term falls in a new academic year; therefore the annual loan limit must be prorated because the remaining period of study (a single quarter) is less than a full academic year. Similarly, if a student enrolled in a two-year program not offered in an SAY (where the Title IV academic year covers two 15-week semesters) has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to complete the program requirements, the loan limit must be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester. Note that for standard-term programs or credit-hour programs with SE9W nonstandard terms, the length of the loan period does not determine whether a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year. The determining factor is the length of the remaining period of study in which the student is enrolled, which may not be the same as the loan period. For example, if an undergraduate student is enrolled for a full SAY consisting of fall and spring semesters, and will complete the program at the end of the spring term, but is enrolled less than half time during the spring, the student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan only for the fall semester. Although the loan period (fall only) is shorter than an academic year, the remaining period of study (fall through spring) is a full academic year. Therefore, if the student receives a Direct Loan in the fall, proration of the annual loan limit is not required. In a clock-hour program, non-term program, or a program with non-SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of study is considered less than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program9s defined Title IV academic year. In contrast to standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, if a student enrolled in a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is in a remaining period of study shorter than an academic year and receives a Direct Loan, the loan period and the remaining period of study will always be the same. This is because for these programs the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program (or remaining portion of a program) or the academic year. For all types of programs, you determine the prorated loan limit for a student enrolled in a remaining period of study less than an academic year by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by the following fraction: Unlike proration for programs that are shorter than an academic year, there is no comparison of weeks and hours. Only the credit or clock hours that the student is scheduled to attend, or is actually attending, at the time of origination are used in the calculation.', '<2-hop>\n\nProration Examples: Remaining Periods of Study Shorter Than an Academic Year Examples 3 through 7 illustrate how the prorated annual loan limit is determined when a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study shorter than an academic year.

A payment period that begins before July 1 and ends on or after July 1 is called a <crossover payment period.= The formula for calculating the payment for a crossover payment period is the same as that for any other payment period in the award year. Crossover Payment From the Proper Award Year For Pell purposes, you must consider a crossover payment period to occur entirely within one award year and calculate the student9s Pell award and disburse Pell funds from the award year selected. If you only have a valid FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR from one award year, you must rely on that record and the award year to which the valid FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR pertains. Aside from these considerations, the decision about which award year to use is based on the student9s remaining eligibility in the earlier award year. This assessment is made according to your school9s payment period policy, which for crossover Pell payment periods may apply to: an individual student; all students or a category of students without exception; or all students or a category of students with allowance for exceptions in the case of individual students. Although you may assign a crossover payment period to either of the relevant award years (subject to the limitations described below), you must make the assignment based on what you determine will be most beneficial to students. You may assign the Pell Grant award to a different award year than the rest of the student9s Title IV aid. You can make a payment for a crossover payment period out of either award year if the student has a valid FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR for the award year selected. You may assign two consecutive crossover payment periods to the same award year. For example, you could treat summer 2025 and summer 2026 as both being in the 2025-26 award year. You may also source the Pell funds from different award years for different students, as their eligibility allows, depending on their remaining eligibility and financial need. You may not make a payment which will result in the student receiving more than their Scheduled Award for an award year, unless the student is eligible for a Year-Round Pell award (see Year-Round Pell Grant section later in this chapter), in which case the student may be eligible to receive up to 150% of their Scheduled Award for the award year.

As noted earlier, the other aid that must be considered is called <other financial assistance= (OFA). OFA is generally used in the same way for the Direct Loan Program as for the TEACH Grant and Campus-Based programs. However, there are differences in the treatment of AmeriCorps benefits, as discussed later in this chapter. In general, OFA as defined for the Direct Loan, Campus-Based, and TEACH Grant programs refers to aid from the Title IV programs, as well as other grants, scholarships, loans, and wages from need-based employment that you can reasonably anticipate at the time you award aid to the student, whether the assistance is awarded by the school or by an individual or organization outside the school. If aid is excluded from either OFA or COA, that amount must be excluded from both OFA and COA. For Direct Loans, the regulations specify that OFA is aid that the student will receive for the same period of enrollment as the loan. As noted in Chapter 1, it9s usually best to originate a loan for a period that matches the academic year or other period that you9re using to award funds from other Title IV programs. The amount of a private education loan which exceeds the SAI when substituting for the SAI is considered OFA. When classifying non-Title IV sources of aid, if a student receives the award because of postsecondary enrollment (for example, a scholarship from a local social club that requires a student to be attending a postsecondary school), it counts as OFA if it is not considered wages for employment according to federal or state rules, or if it is considered wages and is based on need. Any amount that appears as income on the tax return will also be included on the appropriate line on the FAFSA form in the section for student income. If the award is considered wages for employment but is not based on need, then it is not OFA and it remains in income. Compensation that a student athlete receives under a name, image, and likeness (NIL) contract is a non-need-based source of income and therefore is not considered OFA.

The student can also receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in the amount of $2,050 to replace the SAI and fully cover the COA: $9,000 COA - $5,450 Pell - $1,000 FSEOG - $500 Direct Subsidized Loan = $2,050 Direct Unsubsidized Loan eligibility The aid package now fully covers the student9s COA: $9,000 COA - $5,450 Pell - $1,000 FSEOG - $500 Direct Subsidized Loan - $2,050 Direct Unsubsidized Loan = $0 unmet cost *The $5,450 Pell Grant amount shown in this example is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent the actual Pell Grant amount that a student would be eligible to receive. See Volume 7 for guidance on the determination of Pell Grant awards.']","For programs offered in modules, the minimum loan period rules for Direct Loans remain unchanged. The minimum loan period is still the term, even if the student does not attend all modules within the term. When awarding Direct Loans, other financial assistance (OFA) must be considered. OFA includes aid from Title IV programs, as well as other grants, scholarships, loans, and wages from need-based employment that can be reasonably anticipated at the time of awarding aid. The regulations specify that OFA is aid the student will receive for the same period of enrollment as the loan.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does Chapter 5's example of combining modules into one term relate to the verification exemption scenario in Chapter 4?,"['<1-hop>\n\nWhen you combine the modules into a single term, a student cannot be paid more than the amount for one payment period for completing any combination of the modules. If the modules are not combined into a single payment period and they do not overlap each other, you must treat each module as a separate nonstandard term and generally must use Formula 3 to calculate Pell Grant payments for the program. If, for each module, you define full time as at least 12 credit hours, you may be able to use Formula 1 or 2 if the program otherwise qualifies for one of these formulas. If a combined module term crosses over the June 30 award year end date to include the July 1 award year begin date, the combined term must be treated as a crossover payment period regardless of which modules students attend. If your program has two summer modules and only one of the modules crosses over the award year date boundary and you do not combine the sessions into a larger term, then only the term that spans the award year boundary is considered a crossover payment period. If the modules are combined in a single term and a student does not begin attendance in all the modules that they were expected to attend, recalculation of prior disbursements is required based on the resulting changed enrollment status. Also, if you use Formula 3 for any of the summer modules, or any other nonstandard term (e.g., a winter intersession that is not attached to an adjacent standard term), remember that you must also use it for all other terms in the award year, including fall through spring. student9s enrollment intensity is equal to the proportion of the number of credits for which the student is enrolled to the number of credit hours in the school9s definition of full-time enrollment for the combined term. Therefore, the student9s enrollment intensity is 50% for the combined summer term. Volume 7, Chapter 5, Example 2: Modules Combined Into One Term A student enrolls part time at a school which defines its academic year as 24 semester hours and 30 weeks of instructional time. In addition to fall and spring semesters, the school offers three summer modules. Each module provides four weeks of instructional time (as defined in Volume 3, Chapter 1). The school can either combine the modules into a single standard term or treat each module as a separate nonstandard term. The school chooses to combine the modules into a single term providing 12 weeks of instructional time with full-time enrollment defined as 12 semester hours. If the school meets the conditions for use of Formula 1 in its fall and spring semesters, it can use Formula 1 to calculate Pell Grant payments for this summer session. The student enrolls for three semester hours in each of the modules (nine hours total in the combined term) which is 75% enrollment intensity. The student9s Scheduled Award is $7,500 and their annual award is $5,625 ($7,500 x 75%). To calculate the student9s payment, the school simply divides the annual award by two, the number of terms in the fall through spring: $5,625/2 = $2,812.50. The school may round the payment up to $2,813.', '<2-hop>\n\nVerification Exemption Example AVG, Chapter 4, Example 1: A student is enrolled in their local community college and their application is selected for verification. The student provides their spouse9s information on the application but now explains that the spouse recently moved out and is unreachable. The student provides their school documents to show that']","Chapter 5's example discusses the process of combining summer modules into a single term for calculating Pell Grant payments, emphasizing the importance of enrollment intensity and the use of specific formulas for financial aid calculations. In contrast, Chapter 4's verification exemption scenario involves a student whose application is selected for verification, but they face challenges in providing required information due to a change in their personal circumstances. Both examples highlight different aspects of managing student financial aid: Chapter 5 focuses on the technical calculation of aid based on enrollment, while Chapter 4 addresses the procedural flexibility needed when students encounter verification issues.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How do the requirements for completing the FAFSA form, as outlined in Volume 6, relate to determining a student's financial need and eligibility for Title IV aid as described in Volume 1?","['<1-hop>\n\nThe ISIR will only display the federal school code of the receiving school. The information of other schools the student included on the FAFSA form will not appear except on the FAFSA Submission Summary and on ISIRs sent to state grant agencies. See Volume 6 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specification Guide.  FAFSA Submission Summary and on ISIRs sent to state grant agencies. See Volume 6 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specification Guide. Student Consent, Approval, and Signature (24) Every student must provide the following to be eligible for Title IV aid: Consent 3 The student must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the IRS. Approval 3 The student must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may receive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI). Signature 3 The student9s FSA ID (account username and password) will serve as their signature on the online FAFSA form. Paper (PDF) FAFSA form filers will provide a physical signature on their form. In addition to certifying that the data on the FAFSA form is correct, the student is also signing a statement of educational purpose, which is required to receive Title IV funds. Among other things, the student agrees to spend Title IV funds only on educational expenses and affirms that they are not in default on a federal loan and do not owe a grant overpayment. FAFSA Submission Students who do not have any other required contributors now have a complete FAFSA form. Students who complete and submit their FAFSA form online will receive an email version of their confirmation page. When the applicant9s FAFSA form is processed, students who provided an email address will receive an email notification of processing with instructions to access their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary. Applicants with additional required contributors will need these individuals to contribute to their FAFSA form, as described next. Contributor: Student Spouse This section consists of five questions related to the student9s spouse. The student9s spouse is a required contributor on the FAFSA form if the student is married and did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse. If a married student is completing the FAFSA form online and the student9s spouse is identified as a required contributor, the student will be prompted to enter their spouse9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and email address) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The student spouse will be notified by email that they have been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The spouse should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and password to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s spouse is not a required contributor, the student will enter the same identifying information and email address, but the student9s spouse will not be invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. If the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their spouse complete the student spouse contributor section.', '<2-hop>\n\nChapter 2 Cost of Attendance (Budget) Awards for most of the Title IV programs are based on some form of financial need. Unlike scholarship programs that may award funds based on academic merit or the student9s field of study, <need-based= grants, loans, and work-study are based on the student9s demonstrated financial need for assistance. The cost of attendance (COA) is the cornerstone of establishing a student9s financial need, as it sets a limit on the total aid that a student may receive for purposes of the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, and is one of the basic components of the Pell Grant calculation. This chapter picks up at the point where the Student Aid Index (SAI) for a student has been determined. See Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide for more information on the SAI, and Volume 1 for more information on basic student eligibility requirements. Most schools establish average costs for different categories of students and set these cost categories in EDExpress or other software that they use to determine awards and package aid. The typical costs that you establish for your students will be used to calculate their Title IV award amounts and package their aid.']","The requirements for completing the FAFSA form, as outlined in Volume 6, include providing consent for the disclosure of identifying information to the IRS, approval for the U.S. Department of Education to use and redisclose federal tax information, and a signature that certifies the accuracy of the FAFSA data and the student's educational purpose. These requirements are crucial for determining a student's eligibility for Title IV aid. Volume 1 further explains that a student's financial need, which is essential for awarding Title IV aid, is determined by the cost of attendance (COA) and the Student Aid Index (SAI). The COA sets a limit on the total aid a student may receive, and the SAI is used to calculate the student's financial need. Together, these volumes ensure that students meet the necessary criteria to receive financial assistance based on their demonstrated financial need.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
