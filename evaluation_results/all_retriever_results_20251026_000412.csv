What are Direct Subsidized Loans?,"['Chapter 1\nStudent and Parent Eligibility for Direct Loans\nOverview\nTo be eligible for Direct Loans, a student must be enrolled on at least a half-time basis at a school that participates in the\nDirect Loan Program, and students and parents must meet the general federal student aid eligibility requirements\ncovered in Volume 1 of the Federal Student Aid Handbook. This chapter discusses other eligibility requirements that are\nspecific to the Direct Loan Program.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\nOnly students who have financial need may receive Direct Subsidized Loans. The federal government does not charge\ninterest on Direct Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled on at least a half-time basis, during the grace and\ndeferment periods, and during certain other periods (for example, during certain periods of repayment under certain\nrepayment plans that determine the required monthly payment amount based on the borrower9s income and family size).\nIf a student has received a determination of need for a Direct Subsidized Loan in an amount of $200 or less, a school may\nchoose not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and may instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan.\nFinancial need is not an eligibility requirement to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. The federal government generally\ncharges interest on Direct Unsubsidized Loans during all periods, with limited exceptions (for example, during periods of\ndeferment for cancer treatment).\nTo be eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, an undergraduate student attending a\nschool that participates in the Federal Pell Grant Program must first have received a determination of their Pell Grant\neligibility for the period of enrollment for which the student is requesting a loan.\nNo Minimum Age To Receive a Direct Loan\nStudents who are minors may receive Direct Loans, but they may not refuse to repay the loans based on a <defense of\ninfancy= (that is, by claiming that they were too young to enter into the contract of signing the promissory note).\nRequirement To Offer Both Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans\nDirect Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are two components of a single loan program. A school may not choose\nto make only Direct Subsidized Loans or only Direct Unsubsidized Loans available to its eligible students. For more\nDirect Loan Program Regulations\n34 CFR Part 685\nNo Defense of Infancy\nHigher Education Act (HEA) Sec. 484A(b)(2)', 'Direct Loans at Multiple Schools\nA student who is concurrently enrolled and eligible at more than one school may receive Direct Loans at each school. If\nthe student is receiving Direct Subsidized Loans or Direct Unsubsidized Loans, the schools that the student is attending\nare responsible for coordinating to make sure that the total amount of the loans the student receives does not exceed the\napplicable annual or aggregate loan limit. In addition, the schools must ensure that there is no duplication of non-\ninstitutional costs when determining the student9s COA. Note that in the situation where a student is concurrently enrolled\nand eligible at more than one school, which is different than the consortium arrangements discussed in Volume 2, Chapter\n2, loan funds awarded at one school are not to be included as OFA by any other school the student is attending when\ndetermining the student9s loan eligibility for the same period.\nExceptions to the <Regular Student= Requirement for Direct Loans\nAs explained in Volume 1, Chapter 1, one of the eligibility requirements for a student to receive Title IV aid is that the\nstudent must be enrolled at an eligible school for the purpose of obtaining a degree or certificate offered by the school.\nSuch a student is known as a <regular student.= However, there are two limited exceptions to this requirement for Direct\nLoans: preparatory coursework and teacher certification coursework.\nPreparatory Coursework\nA student may receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan (or a parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan\non behalf of a dependent student) for preparatory coursework that the school has documented is necessary for the\nstudent to enroll in an eligible program. The preparatory courses must be offered as part of an eligible program offered by\nthe school, though the student does not have to be enrolled in that program. A school may not award Direct Loans for\nstandalone courses that do not count towards an eligible program and exist solely to serve as preparatory coursework.\nA student who is enrolled at least half time in preparatory coursework as described above is eligible to receive loans for a\nmaximum of one consecutive 12-month period (not per program) beginning on the first day of the loan period. If the\nconsecutive 12-month period of preparatory coursework spans more than one academic year, the student may receive\nmore than one annual loan limit.\nTo be eligible for loans under this exception, the student must be taking classes that are a prerequisite for admission. A\nstudent who is only taking courses to raise their grade-point average in order to be admitted does not qualify.\nPreparatory Coursework at a Different School\nRegular Student\n34 CFR 600.2\nPreparatory Coursework\n34 CFR 668.32(a)(1)(ii)\n34 CFR 685.203(a)(6) and (c)(2)(vi)', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default. Your school can also offer financial literacy classes, on a credit or non-credit basis, that include\ninformation on budgeting, debt management, anticipated earnings by profession, elements of loan counseling, etc.,\nthough eligibility for a Direct Loan cannot be contingent on completion of such a class.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrowers\nBelow we provide a summary of the information that must be covered in entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan\nand Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers. For more detailed information, refer to the regulations cited at the end of this\nsection.\nEntrance counseling for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loan borrowers must:\nExplain the use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN);\nEmphasize the importance of the loan repayment obligation;\nDescribe the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, delinquent debt collection procedures\nunder Federal law, and litigation;\nEmphasize that the borrower must repay the full amount of the loan even if the borrower does not complete the\nprogram, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain\nemployment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services\nthat the student paid for with the loan;\nInform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on a range of student levels of\nindebtedness depending on the types of loans the borrower has received, or based on the average indebtedness of\nother borrowers in the same program at the same school;\nExplain how accepting the loan will affect the borrower9s eligibility for other forms of student financial assistance;\nProvide information on how interest accrues and is capitalized during periods when the interest is not paid by either\nthe borrower or the Department;\nInform the borrower of the option to pay the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan while the borrower is in school;\nExplain the definition of half-time enrollment at the school and the consequences of not maintaining half-time\nenrollment;\nExplain the importance of contacting the appropriate offices at the school if the borrower withdraws before\nDirect Loan Entrance Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(a)\nLoan Counseling Requirements and Flexibilities\nDCL GEN-15-06', 'information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form\nIf you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information\nsections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the\nstudent, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up\nto the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent\nsecond-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume\nfor information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of\nthe other Title IV programs.\nSelf-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or\nhave refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated\nstatement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students\nwithout parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide.\nDirect PLUS Loans\nDirect PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate\nstudents.\nA parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who\nmeets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a\nstudent. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is\nineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent\nwho had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements\noutlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal\ngovernment holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s\nineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student\nis otherwise eligible.\nRequirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers\nSchools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan\nProgram and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available\nto both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students. For more information, see the\ndiscussion under <Direct PLUS Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDefinition of <Parent= for Direct PLUS Loan Purposes\nIf they meet all other Direct PLUS Loan eligibility requirements, the following individuals can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on\nbehalf of a dependent undergraduate student:\nThe student9s biological parent;\nThe student9s legal adoptive parent; or\nThe student9s stepparent (spouse of the student9s biological or legal adoptive parent at the time of application), but\nonly if the stepparent is required to provide their information on the FAFSA form in accordance with the instructions\non the FAFSA form.\nGrandparents and other family members are not eligible to take out Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent\nundergraduate student unless they have legally adopted the student.\nIn addition to the parent(s) whose resources are reported on a student9s FAFSA form, any otherwise eligible biological or\nlegal adoptive parent of the dependent undergraduate student can also take out a Direct PLUS Loan on the student9s\nbehalf, even if that parent9s information is not reported on the FAFSA form.\nNote also that more than one parent can take out a Direct PLUS Loan on behalf of the same dependent undergraduate', 'Chapter 3\nDirect Loan Origination, Loan Periods, and Disbursements\nOrigination Overview\nOrigination is the process of creating a Direct Loan award in the school9s system. Before originating a Direct Loan, a\nschool must determine the student9s or parent9s eligibility for the loan. For each Direct Loan that a school disburses to a\nstudent or parent, the school must submit a loan award record to the COD System that includes the student9s grade level,\nthe loan period and academic year dates, the loan amount, the anticipated and actual dates and amounts of the loan\ndisbursements, and other information. Submission of a loan award record serves as the school9s certification that it has\ndetermined the borrower9s eligibility for the loan.\nThe specific Direct Loan amount that a student or parent borrower is eligible to receive is determined based on various\nfactors such as the student9s COA, Student Aid Index (SAI), OFA, and remaining eligibility under the annual and aggregate\nloan limits (see Chapter 4 for guidance on annual and aggregate loan limits). Some of these factors are relevant only\nwhen determining eligibility for certain types of Direct Loans. When originating a Direct Loan, the COA used in\ndetermining the loan amount may include only those costs associated with the period of enrollment (loan period) for\nwhich the loan is being originated.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans have annual and aggregate limits that are the same for all\nstudents at a given grade level and dependency status. You may not originate a Direct Loan for an amount that:\nExceeds the amount requested by the borrower;\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus the student9s SAI and OFA;\nIn the case of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan or Direct PLUS Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus OFA; or\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, would cause the student to exceed the annual or\naggregate limit.\nSee Volume 3, Chapter 3 for more information on packaging Direct Loans as part of a student9s financial aid award.\nOriginating a Loan\nIt9s important to remember that your school, not the Department, is responsible for determining a borrower9s eligibility for\na Direct Loan. Schools that originate and disburse loans to ineligible borrowers, or for loan amounts that exceed loan\nlimits or financial need, are subject to administrative actions such as a fine, limitation, suspension, and termination, as\nwell as liabilities including repayment to the government of interest and costs it has paid on the ineligible loans.\nYou must originate a Direct Loan while the student is enrolled and eligible for the period of enrollment for which the loan\nis intended. You may not originate a loan for a period in which the student is no longer enrolled. For example, you may\nnot originate a loan for a prior academic year that has ended, even if the student is enrolled and eligible for the current\nacademic year. Similarly, if a student who was enrolled at least half time only for the fall and spring quarters of an\nacademic year consisting of fall, winter, and spring quarters does not request a loan until the spring, you may not at that\ntime originate a loan for the previous fall quarter.\nFor all Direct Loans, you must document the student9s COA, SAI, and OFA in the student9s file. This information must be\nmade available to the Department upon request.\nYou must confirm that the borrower meets the definition of eligible borrower by doing the following:\nDetermine that the student is enrolled at least half time and making satisfactory academic progress (see Volume 1);\nReview the NSLDS information on the ISIR or the NSLDS Professional Access website to ensure that the student is not\nin default, does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant or loan (see Volume 1), and will not exceed the annual or\naggregate loan limits (as described in Chapter 4 of this volume);\nEnsure that the amount of the loan, in combination with other aid, will not exceed the student9s financial need or']","['information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.

The key features of Direct Subsidized Loans include:

1. **Eligibility Based on Financial Need**: Only students who have been determined to have financial need are eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans.

2. **Interest Subsidy**: The federal government pays the interest on these loans while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time, during the grace period, and during deferment periods. This means that borrowers do not accrue interest during these times, making it a more affordable option compared to other loans.

3. **Loan Amounts**: If a student is determined to need a Direct Subsidized Loan for an amount of $200 or less, the school may opt not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.

4. **Repayment Obligations**: Borrowers are required to repay the full amount of the loan even if they do not complete their program, do not find employment after graduation, or are dissatisfied with their education.

In summary, Direct Subsidized Loans are designed to help students with financial need by providing loans without accruing interest during certain periods, making them a beneficial option for eligible borrowers.","The context does not provide specific information about Direct Subsidized Loans, but it mentions that dependent undergraduate students whose parents refuse to complete the FAFSA form or have ended financial support may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans.",1.0,0.9090909090909091,0.0,0.9424541839846814,0.6666666644444444,0.13636363636363635,naive_rag

The student enrolls in courses that are\npart of one of the school9s undergraduate degree programs, but is not enrolled for the purpose of receiving a\ndegree and therefore is not a regular student.

Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of a Direct Loan\nuntil a student has begun attendance in enough hours to establish half-time enrollment status. However, if a school has\nnot yet made a Direct Loan disbursement to a student who has dropped classes, and the school determines that the\nstudent never began attendance in enough classes to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a\nfirst disbursement of a Direct Loan to that student.\nLikewise, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules drops all future classes before beginning attendance in\nenough modules to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan\nbecause the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis.

Most schools establish average costs for different categories of students and set these cost categories in EDExpress or other software that they use to determine awards and package aid. The typical costs that you establish for your students will be used to calculate their Title IV award amounts and package their aid.', '<2-hop>\n\nAllowable Costs The HEA specifies the types of costs that are included in the COA, but each school must determine the appropriate and reasonable amounts to include for each eligible COA category for its students, based on the criteria described in this chapter. The COA for a student is an estimate of that student9s educational expenses for the period of enrollment. As you9ll see, in most cases you can use average expenses (for students with the same enrollment status) at your school, rather than actual expenses. For example, for the tuition and fees component, you can use the same average amount for all full-time students instead of figuring the actual tuition and fees for each individual student. You can have different standard costs for different categories of students, such as one COA for out-of-state students, who are charged higher tuition, and a different COA for in-state students, who are charged lower tuition. However, you cannot combine the COA figures for each separate enrollment status and award aid to a student based on the average COA. Students must be awarded based on a COA comprised of allowable costs assessed all students carrying the same academic workload. If a student is enrolled in a program that has extra fees or costs, such as lab fees, you can add those fees to the student9s cost or use a standard cost that you9ve established for all students in that program. If you establish standard cost categories, you must apply the cost allowances uniformly to all students in those categories. There are a variety of methods to arrive at average costs for your students, such as conducting periodic surveys of your student population, assessing local housing costs or other pertinent data, or other reasonable methods you may devise which generate accurate average costs for various categories of students. The types of costs that may be included are the same for all Title IV programs. For the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, the COA, based on the student9s enrollment status, is a student9s cost for the period for which the aid is intended. For Pell Grants, the COA is always the full-year costs for a full-time student, so you may have to prorate actual or average costs up for students who are attending less than an academic year (or who are less than full time in a term-based program) or prorate down for students who are attending for periods longer than an academic year. Note that though certain components are excluded from the Pell Grant COA for a student who is enrolled on a less-than-half-time basis, the components that are included in the less-than-half-time Pell Grant COA are still based on the full-year costs for a full-time student for a Pell Grant recipient with an enrollment intensity below 50%. See Volume 7 for guidance on Pell Grant requirements. The types of costs included in the COA are determined by section 472 of the HEA and are the only costs that may be included in a student9s COA. If a cost is not listed below, it may not be included as part of the COA. Unless it is specifically noted in the discussion of COA categories below that a particular category applies only to students who are enrolled at least half time, the types of expenses that may be included in the COA are the same for all students, regardless of enrollment status.']","The Cost of Attendance (COA) plays a crucial role in determining a student's financial aid eligibility, particularly for Direct Loans under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. The COA represents the total estimated cost of attending a postsecondary institution, which includes tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and other related expenses.

When determining a student's eligibility for Direct Loans, schools must consider the COA alongside other factors such as the Student Aid Index (SAI) and any other financial aid the student may be receiving (referred to as Other Financial Aid, or OFA). Specifically, the amount of Direct Subsidized Loans a student can receive is calculated as the COA minus the SAI and OFA. For Direct Unsubsidized Loans or Direct PLUS Loans, the calculation is based on the COA minus OFA.

Allowable costs factored into the COA calculation include only those expenses that are directly associated with the period of enrollment for which the loan is being originated. This means that schools must ensure that the COA reflects the actual costs incurred during the specific loan period, and they must avoid duplicating non-institutional costs when determining the COA for students who are concurrently enrolled at multiple institutions.

For example, if a student is attending two schools and receiving financial aid from both, the schools must coordinate to ensure that the total amount of loans does not exceed the applicable annual or aggregate loan limits, and that the COA does not include overlapping costs from both institutions.

In summary, the COA is a fundamental component in assessing a student's financial aid eligibility, as it directly influences the amount of Direct Loans a student can receive, ensuring that the financial aid awarded aligns with the actual costs of education.","The Cost of Attendance (COA) is crucial in determining a student's financial aid eligibility as it sets a limit on the total aid a student may receive for programs like Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs. It is a fundamental component in calculating a student's financial need, which is necessary for awarding need-based grants, loans, and work-study. The COA is an estimate of a student's educational expenses for the enrollment period and includes allowable costs as specified by the Higher Education Act (HEA). Schools must determine appropriate and reasonable amounts for each COA category based on criteria such as enrollment status and may use average expenses for students with similar enrollment statuses. Allowable costs are standardized and must be applied uniformly to all students within the same category, ensuring that aid is awarded based on a COA comprised of these allowable costs.",1.0,1.0,0.33,0.9452602070696058,0.06666666662222222,0.35294117647058826,naive_rag
"How does the FAFSA Simplification Act impact the calculation of student aid for periods shorter than nine months, and what role does the FUTURE Act play in verifying income and tax information for FAFSA applicants?","['Volume 8\nThe Direct Loan Program\nIntroduction\nUnder the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loan Program), the U.S. Department of Education (the\nDepartment) makes loans to help students and parents pay the cost of attendance (COA) at a postsecondary school. This\nvolume of the Federal Student Aid Handbook provides information to assist schools in determining student and parent\neligibility for Direct Loans, counseling student borrowers, and awarding Direct Loans.\nChanges for 2025-2026\nWe have made the following changes in Volume 8 for 2025-2026:\nIn Chapter 3, we have revised the discussion of loan periods to provide a limited exception to the longstanding\nrequirement that the loan period for a Direct Loan may not include any terms in which the borrower is ineligible to\nreceive Direct Loan funds.\nAlso in Chapter 3, we have added a slightly revised and expanded version of guidance on the treatment of Direct\nLoan disbursements made after the date of a borrower9s death that was previously in Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the FSA\nHandbook under the heading <Checking Eligibility at the Time of Disbursement.= Because this guidance is specific to\nDirect Loans, we believe Volume 8 is a more appropriate location.\nIn Chapter 5, we have revised Example 6 to reflect the limited exception to the requirement that a loan period may\nnot include terms in which the borrower is ineligible (see Chapter 3 changes above).\nIn Chapter 7, we have revised the discussion of transfer students and abbreviated loan periods to clarify that in some\ncircumstances a transfer student may be eligible to receive more Direct Loan funds for the program at the new\nschool than a non-transfer student would be eligible to receive for that same program.\nExcept as noted above, there are no other substantive changes to Volume 8 for 2025-2026.', 'Regardless of the counseling methods your school uses, it must document that the student received entrance and exit\ncounseling, and it must ensure that an individual with expertise in the Title IV programs is reasonably available shortly\nafter the counseling to answer the student9s questions.\nCounseling for Correspondence and Study Abroad Students\nIf a first-time student borrower has enrolled in a study-abroad program (approved by a U.S. school for credit) or a\ncorrespondence or distance learning program, the school must document that the student has completed online entrance\ncounseling that meets the regulatory Direct Loan entrance counseling requirements or provide written entrance\ncounseling information by mail or email before making the first disbursement of a Direct Loan to the student.\nIn the case of exit counseling for correspondence programs or study abroad programs, the school may mail or email the\nborrower written counseling materials within 30 days after the borrower completes the program, with a request that they\nprovide the contact and personal information that would ordinarily have been collected through the counseling process.\nProviding Additional Information\nYour school can take additional steps to counsel students, such as assisting them with developing a budget, estimating\nneed for loans, and planning for repayment. You can also reinforce messages to borrowers. For example, with each\ndisbursement you can remind students about the importance of maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP; see\nVolume 1, Chapter 1 for details on SAP requirements), planning for future employment, and staying in touch with the loan\nservicer. Sample measures for loan counseling are given in the <Sample Default Prevention Plan= that can be found in the\nregulations cited below.\nPLUS Loan Credit Counseling\nSpecial loan counseling is required for any student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has been determined to\nhave an adverse credit history, but who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan either by getting a loan endorser or by\ndocumenting to the satisfaction of the Department that there are extenuating circumstances related to the adverse\ncredit. While the special PLUS Loan Credit Counseling is mandatory only for these borrowers, any PLUS borrower can\nvoluntarily complete this counseling. See Chapter 1 of this volume for more information about adverse credit.\nNote that the special counseling described above is separate from the entrance counseling that all first-time graduate and\nprofessional student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers must complete, as described earlier in this chapter.\nAnnual Student Loan Acknowledgement\nThe Department offers a tool on the StudentAid.gov website called the Annual Student Loan Acknowledgement.

See <When A Student Fails to Begin Attendance= in Volume 4, Chapter 3.\nIf a student does not withdraw but ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a school may make a late\ndisbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred by the student for a period in which the student was eligible. However,\nthis does not apply if the student dropped all future classes or modules, because the student never began classes as a\nhalf-time student.\nTitle IV program funds (including Direct Loans) are disbursed to a student on the presumption that the student will attend\nthe hours for which aid has been awarded. Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of a Direct Loan\nuntil a student has begun attendance in enough hours to establish half-time enrollment status. However, if a school has\nnot yet made a Direct Loan disbursement to a student who has dropped classes, and the school determines that the\nstudent never began attendance in enough classes to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a\nfirst disbursement of a Direct Loan to that student.\nLikewise, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules drops all future classes before beginning attendance in\nenough modules to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan\nbecause the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis. If a student who dropped to less-than-half-time\nstatus resumes enrollment on a half-time basis during the payment period or period of enrollment, the school may make\nremaining disbursements of a Direct Loan if the school documents (1) the student9s revised COA, and (2) that the student\ncontinues to qualify for the entire amount of the loan, despite any reduction in the student9s COA caused by the\ntemporary cessation of enrollment on at least a half-time basis.\nDCL GEN-16-10\nLate Disbursements for Students Who Cease To Be Enrolled at Least Half Time\n34 CFR 668.164(j)(3)(iii)\nDirect Loan Disbursements to Students Who Temporarily Cease Half-Time Enrollment\n34 CFR 685.303(b)(3)(iv)', ""provided by those companies are already offered free of charge through the Department or the borrower's loan\nservicer;\nProvide a general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers (i.e. student loan\ninterest deduction); and\nRequire the borrower to provide current information concerning their name, address, Social Security number,\nreferences, and driver9s license number and state of issuance, as well as the borrower9s expected permanent\naddress, the address of their next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower9s expected employer, if known\n(see also <Providing Borrower Information at Separation= below).\nAs stated above, Direct Loan exit counseling must provide borrowers with the information the Department makes\navailable in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA. This section of the law requires the Department to make available\nto postsecondary schools and other entities a wide variety of information about federal student assistance programs,\nincluding information to help students assess the debt burden and repayment obligations that will be incurred as a result\nof receiving Title IV loans. As noted below under <Counseling Methods,= documentation that a borrower has completed the\nDepartment9s online exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan exit counseling requirements. Schools that choose to\nconduct their own exit counseling can meet the requirement to provide borrowers with the information made available by\nthe Department in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA by providing borrowers with a copy of the Department9s\nDirect Loan Exit Counseling Guide.\nProviding Borrower Information at Separation\nSchools that conduct their own exit counseling must provide the current personal information collected from the student\n(name, address, references, etc.) to students9 loan servicers within 60 days.

Your school will receive notification through the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) (see <Required Electronic\nProcesses= in Volume 2, Chapter 3 for more information) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers, and\ncompletion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If your school documents that borrowers have\ncompleted the Department9s online counseling, it has satisfied its counseling responsibility.

If your\nschool conducts in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions\ncan help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive\nprograms to ensure that students understand the terms and conditions of their loans.

This chapter discusses other eligibility requirements that are\nspecific to the Direct Loan Program.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\nOnly students who have financial need may receive Direct Subsidized Loans. The federal government does not charge\ninterest on Direct Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled on at least a half-time basis, during the grace and\ndeferment periods, and during certain other periods (for example, during certain periods of repayment under certain\nrepayment plans that determine the required monthly payment amount based on the borrower9s income and family size).\nIf a student has received a determination of need for a Direct Subsidized Loan in an amount of $200 or less, a school may\nchoose not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and may instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan.\nFinancial need is not an eligibility requirement to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. The federal government generally\ncharges interest on Direct Unsubsidized Loans during all periods, with limited exceptions (for example, during periods of\ndeferment for cancer treatment).\nTo be eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, an undergraduate student attending a\nschool that participates in the Federal Pell Grant Program must first have received a determination of their Pell Grant\neligibility for the period of enrollment for which the student is requesting a loan.\nNo Minimum Age To Receive a Direct Loan\nStudents who are minors may receive Direct Loans, but they may not refuse to repay the loans based on a <defense of\ninfancy= (that is, by claiming that they were too young to enter into the contract of signing the promissory note).\nRequirement To Offer Both Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans\nDirect Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are two components of a single loan program. A school may not choose\nto make only Direct Subsidized Loans or only Direct Unsubsidized Loans available to its eligible students. For more\nDirect Loan Program Regulations\n34 CFR Part 685\nNo Defense of Infancy\nHigher Education Act (HEA) Sec. 484A(b)(2)']","[""<1-hop>\n\nPrior to the 2024-2025 award year, the HEA allowed schools to use alternate expected family contributions (EFCs) when packaging aid for periods other than nine months. The FAFSA Simplification Act eliminated this provision. Beginning with the 2024-2025 award year, when packaging aid for any period that is not nine months, schools must use a student9s calculated 9-month SAI in the formula to determine eligibility for need-based aid, as described above (that is, COA 3 SAI 3 OFA = need). As a result of this change, students who are enrolled for periods shorter than nine months will have less financial need than would have been the case in the past when using an alternate (smaller) EFC for such periods. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more information on how this change may affect Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for students receiving loans for periods of enrollment (loan periods) shorter than nine months. Treatment of Negative SAIs A student may have a calculated SAI that is a negative number as low as -1,500. Also, as explained in Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide, certain students will automatically receive a -1,500 SAI. When packaging need-based aid for students with negative SAIs, schools must convert any negative SAIs to zero for awarding purposes. This means that a negative SAI will not increase the amount of need-based aid a student can receive. Note that a negative SAI also does not increase the amount of non-need-based aid that a student may receive because the SAI is not a factor in determining eligibility for aid that isn9t based on financial need. Packaging Rules Pell Grants as the First Source of Aid Pell Grants are the first source of aid for a student, and packaging Title IV funds begins with determining a student9s Pell Grant eligibility, as described in Volume 7. A correctly determined Pell Grant is never adjusted to take into account other forms of aid. When awarding aid from the other Title IV programs, you must ensure that the student9s need or COA is not exceeded. In some cases, a student9s aid package may include a Pell Grant and non-Title IV aid (for example, institutional aid or private education loans), but no other types of Title IV aid, and the combination of the Pell Grant and the other aid may be large enough to exceed the student9s COA. For instance, the National Collegiate Athletic Association9s (NCAA's) rules for athletic aid may permit a school to award athletic aid that covers a student9s full COA (see <NCAA Considerations= in Chapter 2 of this volume for more information). In this case, the student is still eligible for the full amount of the Pell Grant. However, you can9t award any Title IV funds other than the Pell Grant. Note that in some cases a student9s SAI may be higher than the COA, resulting in no financial need, but the student may still qualify for a calculated Pell Grant or a minimum Pell Grant (see Volume 7, Chapter 2 for more information on Pell Grant eligibility criteria). As an example, consider a student with an SAI of 6,650, a COA of $5,500, and a calculated Pell Grant amount of $745. In this circumstance the student is still eligible for the full Pell Grant amount (as long as it doesn9t exceed the COA), but you may not award any other types of need-based Title IV aid. If a student9s aid package includes a Pell Grant, other types of Title IV aid, and non-Title IV aid, and the total aid amount exceeds the student9s COA, the student still qualifies for the full Pell Grant amount, but you must adjust the other Title IV aid to ensure that the COA is not exceeded. In the circumstances described above you may (but are not required to) adjust non-Title IV aid over which you have control in accordance with your school9s policies."", '<2-hop>\n\nVerification Following Disasters The Dear Colleague Letter GEN-17-08 gives general guidance for awarding aid in federally declared disasters. It states that the Secretary will not enforce the verification requirements during the award year for applicants whose records were lost or destroyed because of a disaster if the school has tried to preserve and reconstruct any records. The school must document when it does not perform verification for this reason and use status code <S= when reporting the disbursement of Pell Grants to affected students. Also, the requirement for dependent students to submit a statement signed by a parent regarding family size is waived if the parents cannot provide the signature due to the disaster. The school must note why no parent was able to provide the statement. Schools that experience a local disaster (rather than a federally declared one) that affects Title IV administration should consult their regional school participation division. Acceptable Documentation The FAFSA Simplification Act requires that, wherever possible, the Department use data received directly from the IRS to calculate a student9s SAI and Pell Grant award. The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act (FUTURE Act) requires the Department of Education to access tax information held by the IRS pertaining to FAFSA applicants4and, where applicable, their parents and spouses4through a secure method: the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX). The FUTURE Act amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to mandate the disclosure of FTI directly from the IRS to the Department with an individual9s consent and approval. The FUTURE Act also made providing consent and approval for the exchange of FTI a requirement for receiving federal student aid. Applicants and contributors will be required to provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI directly from the IRS. When FTI is received from the IRS via the FA-DDX, the FTI received is considered verified and no additional documentation is necessary. As a result, the FA-DDX is the fastest, easiest, and most secure method of meeting income and tax verification requirements. The September 4, 2024 Federal Register Notice gives the documentation required for verifying 2025-26 application data, which depends on the item verified, as explained in this section. If you use a verification document, be sure that it is signed, that all required sections are completed, and that any relevant tax or alternative documents are attached. Copies of original documents are acceptable. An original signature on an original document, an original signature on a copy of a document, and a copy of a document with an original signature on it are all valid signatures, unless specifically noted in this chapter. If a copy of the tax return is used, the filer (or at least one of the filers of a joint return) must sign it or the tax preparer must provide their name and SSN, EIN, or PTIN. Suggested Verification Text The Department has developed suggested text that you may use to create a verification document and to verify non-tax items, such as family size. To review the suggested text for 2025-26, please see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10. The suggested text fulfills verification requirements, but schools do not have to use it, except as noted below. Instead, they may develop and use their own (or someone else9s) text, forms, documents, statements, and certifications that are specific to the items required to be verified for a particular student or group of students at the school. However, schools they tried to locate their estranged spouse. The school determines that the student doesn9t need to verify their spouse9s tax and income information. However, the student must still verify their own information. The school may also choose to use professional judgment to remove the spouse9s information from the student9s FAFSA form.']","The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the impact of the FAFSA Simplification Act on the calculation of student aid for periods shorter than nine months, nor does it detail the role of the FUTURE Act in verifying income and tax information for FAFSA applicants.

Before originating a Direct Loan, a\nschool must determine the student9s or parent9s eligibility for the loan. For each Direct Loan that a school disburses to a\nstudent or parent, the school must submit a loan award record to the COD System that includes the student9s grade level,\nthe loan period and academic year dates, the loan amount, the anticipated and actual dates and amounts of the loan\ndisbursements, and other information. Submission of a loan award record serves as the school9s certification that it has\ndetermined the borrower9s eligibility for the loan.\nThe specific Direct Loan amount that a student or parent borrower is eligible to receive is determined based on various\nfactors such as the student9s COA, Student Aid Index (SAI), OFA, and remaining eligibility under the annual and aggregate\nloan limits (see Chapter 4 for guidance on annual and aggregate loan limits). Some of these factors are relevant only\nwhen determining eligibility for certain types of Direct Loans. When originating a Direct Loan, the COA used in\ndetermining the loan amount may include only those costs associated with the period of enrollment (loan period) for\nwhich the loan is being originated.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans have annual and aggregate limits that are the same for all\nstudents at a given grade level and dependency status.

Schools that originate and disburse loans to ineligible borrowers, or for loan amounts that exceed loan\nlimits or financial need, are subject to administrative actions such as a fine, limitation, suspension, and termination, as\nwell as liabilities including repayment to the government of interest and costs it has paid on the ineligible loans.\nYou must originate a Direct Loan while the student is enrolled and eligible for the period of enrollment for which the loan\nis intended. You may not originate a loan for a period in which the student is no longer enrolled. For example, you may\nnot originate a loan for a prior academic year that has ended, even if the student is enrolled and eligible for the current\nacademic year. Similarly, if a student who was enrolled at least half time only for the fall and spring quarters of an\nacademic year consisting of fall, winter, and spring quarters does not request a loan until the spring, you may not at that\ntime originate a loan for the previous fall quarter.\nFor all Direct Loans, you must document the student9s COA, SAI, and OFA in the student9s file.

The key features of Direct Subsidized Loans include:

1. **Eligibility**: Only students with financial need can receive these loans. To qualify, students must be enrolled at least half-time at a school that participates in the Direct Loan Program and must meet general federal student aid eligibility requirements.

2. **Interest Benefits**: The federal government does not charge interest on Direct Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time, during the grace period, deferment periods, and during certain repayment periods that are based on the borrower's income and family size.

3. **Loan Amounts**: If a student is determined to have a financial need for a Direct Subsidized Loan of $200 or less, the school may opt not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.

4. **Comparison with Direct Unsubsidized Loans**: Unlike Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans do not require a demonstration of financial need, and interest is generally charged during all periods, with some exceptions.

In summary, Direct Subsidized Loans are designed to help eligible undergraduate students cover educational costs without accruing interest while they are in school or during certain periods after graduation.","The context does not provide specific information about Direct Subsidized Loans, but it mentions that dependent undergraduate students whose parents refuse to complete the FAFSA form or have ended financial support may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans.",0.0,0.9375,0.0,0.9457671626285307,0.6666666644444444,0.5625,bm25_rag

This\nvolume of the Federal Student Aid Handbook provides information to assist schools in determining student and parent\neligibility for Direct Loans, counseling student borrowers, and awarding Direct Loans.\nChanges for 2025-2026\nWe have made the following changes in Volume 8 for 2025-2026:\nIn Chapter 3, we have revised the discussion of loan periods to provide a limited exception to the longstanding\nrequirement that the loan period for a Direct Loan may not include any terms in which the borrower is ineligible to\nreceive Direct Loan funds.\nAlso in Chapter 3, we have added a slightly revised and expanded version of guidance on the treatment of Direct\nLoan disbursements made after the date of a borrower9s death that was previously in Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the FSA\nHandbook under the heading <Checking Eligibility at the Time of Disbursement.= Because this guidance is specific to\nDirect Loans, we believe Volume 8 is a more appropriate location.\nIn Chapter 5, we have revised Example 6 to reflect the limited exception to the requirement that a loan period may\nnot include terms in which the borrower is ineligible (see Chapter 3 changes above).\nIn Chapter 7, we have revised the discussion of transfer students and abbreviated loan periods to clarify that in some\ncircumstances a transfer student may be eligible to receive more Direct Loan funds for the program at the new\nschool than a non-transfer student would be eligible to receive for that same program.\nExcept as noted above, there are no other substantive changes to Volume 8 for 2025-2026.', 'Direct Loan Eligibility After Inadvertent Overborrowing\nA student who has inadvertently received Direct Loan funds in excess of the annual or aggregate loan limits is ineligible to\nreceive any Title IV funds until the overborrowing is resolved. As explained in more detail below, the student can regain\neligibility for aid by repaying the amount that exceeded the annual or aggregate loan limits, or by making satisfactory\narrangements with the loan servicer to repay the excess amount.\nThe school where the student is requesting additional Title IV funds is responsible for identifying the loan(s) that resulted\nin the overborrowing, determining that the overborrowing was inadvertent, discussing the overborrowing with the\nstudent, and resolving any discrepancies in the information that is obtained. If the loan(s) that caused the student to\nexceed the annual or aggregate loan limit were received for attendance at a different school, in some cases it may be\nnecessary for the school the student is currently attending to contact the other school for additional information in order\nto determine that the excess borrowing was inadvertent.\nExamples of circumstances that may have resulted in a student inadvertently exceeding an annual or aggregate loan limit\ninclude, but are not limited to:\nSchool processing errors;\nMissing or incorrect NSLDS information; or\nUnintentional student error or omission.\nOverborrowing is not considered inadvertent if there is any evidence that it was the result of deliberate action on the part\nof the school that determined the borrower9s eligibility for the loan, or on the part of the borrower who received the loan.\nIf a school determines that the overborrowing was the result of deliberate action on the part of another school or the\nborrower, it must notify the Department9s Office of the Inspector General and provide evidence (see the contact number\nat the end of this section).\nOnce the school where the student is requesting Title IV funds has documented that the student has either repaid the\nexcess loan amount or has made satisfactory arrangements to repay the excess amount, it may award additional aid. For\nDirect Loans, the student9s eligibility is retroactive to the beginning of the academic year in which the overborrowing was\nresolved.\nA student who regains eligibility after inadvertent overborrowing may or may not be eligible to receive additional loan\nfunds, depending on the circumstances. For example, a dependent undergraduate who inadvertently exceeded the\n$23,000 aggregate limit for subsidized loans could not receive any additional Direct Subsidized Loan funds as a\ndependent undergraduate unless the outstanding debt was paid down below the $23,000 limit (see Chapter 4 of this\nvolume for information on aggregate loan limits). However, the student could potentially receive additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan funds, up to the $31,000 aggregate loan limit, or non-loan aid. An independent undergraduate who\ninadvertently exceeded the $23,000 subsidized limit (but who has not reached the $57,500 combined aggregate loan limit\nfor independent undergraduates) could borrow additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds once they make satisfactory\narrangements to repay the subsidized amount that exceeds $23,000. For more on overborrowing and overawards, see\nVolume 4.\nA student who regains Title IV eligibility after having inadvertently exceeded an annual loan limit for an academic year is\nnot eligible to receive additional Direct Loan funds for that same academic year, but could receive other types of Title IV\naid. However, if the student exceeded only the annual subsidized limit and has regained eligibility, the student would be\neligible to receive Direct Unsubsidized Loans up to the applicable annual maximum.\nNote: A student who inadvertently exceeded an undergraduate annual or aggregate loan limit does not\nautomatically become eligible to receive additional Direct Loans if they become eligible for an increased annual\nloan limit as a result of progressing to a higher grade level, or if they become eligible for a higher aggregate loan\nlimit due to their dependency status changing from dependent to independent or by their enrollment in a\ngraduate or professional degree program. In either case, the inadvertent overborrowing must still be resolved', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default.

Unlike scholarship programs that may award funds based on academic merit or the student9s field of study, <need-based= grants, loans, and work-study are based on the student9s demonstrated financial need for assistance. The cost of attendance (COA) is the cornerstone of establishing a student9s financial need, as it sets a limit on the total aid that a student may receive for purposes of the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, and is one of the basic components of the Pell Grant calculation. This chapter picks up at the point where the Student Aid Index (SAI) for a student has been determined. See Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide for more information on the SAI, and Volume 1 for more information on basic student eligibility requirements. Most schools establish average costs for different categories of students and set these cost categories in EDExpress or other software that they use to determine awards and package aid. The typical costs that you establish for your students will be used to calculate their Title IV award amounts and package their aid.', '<2-hop>\n\nAllowable Costs The HEA specifies the types of costs that are included in the COA, but each school must determine the appropriate and reasonable amounts to include for each eligible COA category for its students, based on the criteria described in this chapter. The COA for a student is an estimate of that student9s educational expenses for the period of enrollment. As you9ll see, in most cases you can use average expenses (for students with the same enrollment status) at your school, rather than actual expenses. For example, for the tuition and fees component, you can use the same average amount for all full-time students instead of figuring the actual tuition and fees for each individual student. You can have different standard costs for different categories of students, such as one COA for out-of-state students, who are charged higher tuition, and a different COA for in-state students, who are charged lower tuition. However, you cannot combine the COA figures for each separate enrollment status and award aid to a student based on the average COA. Students must be awarded based on a COA comprised of allowable costs assessed all students carrying the same academic workload. If a student is enrolled in a program that has extra fees or costs, such as lab fees, you can add those fees to the student9s cost or use a standard cost that you9ve established for all students in that program. If you establish standard cost categories, you must apply the cost allowances uniformly to all students in those categories. There are a variety of methods to arrive at average costs for your students, such as conducting periodic surveys of your student population, assessing local housing costs or other pertinent data, or other reasonable methods you may devise which generate accurate average costs for various categories of students. The types of costs that may be included are the same for all Title IV programs. For the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, the COA, based on the student9s enrollment status, is a student9s cost for the period for which the aid is intended. For Pell Grants, the COA is always the full-year costs for a full-time student, so you may have to prorate actual or average costs up for students who are attending less than an academic year (or who are less than full time in a term-based program) or prorate down for students who are attending for periods longer than an academic year. Note that though certain components are excluded from the Pell Grant COA for a student who is enrolled on a less-than-half-time basis, the components that are included in the less-than-half-time Pell Grant COA are still based on the full-year costs for a full-time student for a Pell Grant recipient with an enrollment intensity below 50%. See Volume 7 for guidance on Pell Grant requirements. The types of costs included in the COA are determined by section 472 of the HEA and are the only costs that may be included in a student9s COA. If a cost is not listed below, it may not be included as part of the COA. Unless it is specifically noted in the discussion of COA categories below that a particular category applies only to students who are enrolled at least half time, the types of expenses that may be included in the COA are the same for all students, regardless of enrollment status.']","The Cost of Attendance (COA) plays a crucial role in determining a student's financial aid eligibility, particularly for Direct Loans under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. The COA represents the total estimated costs associated with attending a postsecondary institution, which can include tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and other related expenses.

When determining a student's eligibility for Direct Loans, the specific loan amount a student can receive is influenced by several factors, including the COA, the Student Aid Index (SAI), and any other financial aid the student may have (referred to as Other Financial Aid, or OFA). For example, the amount of a Direct Subsidized Loan cannot exceed the student's COA minus their SAI and OFA. Similarly, for Direct Unsubsidized Loans, the limit is the COA minus OFA.

Allowable costs factored into the COA calculation include only those expenses that are directly associated with the period of enrollment for which the loan is being originated. This means that schools must ensure that the COA reflects the actual costs incurred during the specific loan period, and they must avoid duplicating non-institutional costs when multiple schools are involved.

In summary, the COA is essential for calculating the maximum loan amounts a student can receive, ensuring that the financial aid awarded aligns with the student's financial need and the costs of their education.","The Cost of Attendance (COA) is crucial in determining a student's financial aid eligibility as it sets a limit on the total aid a student may receive for programs like Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs. It is a fundamental component in calculating a student's financial need, which is necessary for awarding need-based grants, loans, and work-study. The COA is an estimate of a student's educational expenses for the enrollment period and includes allowable costs as specified by the Higher Education Act (HEA). Schools must determine appropriate and reasonable amounts for each COA category based on criteria such as enrollment status and may use average expenses for students with similar enrollment statuses. Allowable costs are standardized and must be applied uniformly to all students within the same category, ensuring that aid is awarded based on a COA comprised of these allowable costs.",1.0,1.0,0.33,0.9452358154676092,0.06666666662222222,0.38461538461538464,bm25_rag
"How does the FAFSA Simplification Act impact the calculation of student aid for periods shorter than nine months, and what role does the FUTURE Act play in verifying income and tax information for FAFSA applicants?","['Chapter 1\nStudent and Parent Eligibility for Direct Loans\nOverview\nTo be eligible for Direct Loans, a student must be enrolled on at least a half-time basis at a school that participates in the\nDirect Loan Program, and students and parents must meet the general federal student aid eligibility requirements\ncovered in Volume 1 of the Federal Student Aid Handbook. This chapter discusses other eligibility requirements that are\nspecific to the Direct Loan Program.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\nOnly students who have financial need may receive Direct Subsidized Loans. The federal government does not charge\ninterest on Direct Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled on at least a half-time basis, during the grace and\ndeferment periods, and during certain other periods (for example, during certain periods of repayment under certain\nrepayment plans that determine the required monthly payment amount based on the borrower9s income and family size).\nIf a student has received a determination of need for a Direct Subsidized Loan in an amount of $200 or less, a school may\nchoose not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and may instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan.\nFinancial need is not an eligibility requirement to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. The federal government generally\ncharges interest on Direct Unsubsidized Loans during all periods, with limited exceptions (for example, during periods of\ndeferment for cancer treatment).\nTo be eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, an undergraduate student attending a\nschool that participates in the Federal Pell Grant Program must first have received a determination of their Pell Grant\neligibility for the period of enrollment for which the student is requesting a loan.\nNo Minimum Age To Receive a Direct Loan\nStudents who are minors may receive Direct Loans, but they may not refuse to repay the loans based on a <defense of\ninfancy= (that is, by claiming that they were too young to enter into the contract of signing the promissory note).\nRequirement To Offer Both Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans\nDirect Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are two components of a single loan program. A school may not choose\nto make only Direct Subsidized Loans or only Direct Unsubsidized Loans available to its eligible students.

For example, if a student9s biological or legal adoptive parents are divorced, they may decide to each take out a\nDirect PLUS Loan for an agreed upon amount (not to exceed the student9s COA, minus other financial assistance (OFA)) to\nhelp pay for the cost of the student9s education.\nRequirement for Dependent Students To File a FAFSA Form\nIn all cases, the dependent student on whose behalf a parent has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan must have filed a FAFSA\nform and received an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or FAFSA Submission Summary (see Chapter 1 of the\nApplication and Verification Guide for information on the ISIR and FAFSA Submission Summary). This requirement ensures\nthat student eligibility data matches are conducted to verify that the dependent student on whose behalf the parent is\nborrowing:\nIs not in default on a Title IV loan and does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant;\nHas had their Social Security number verified by the Social Security Administration; and\nHas had their citizenship status confirmed by either the Social Security Administration or the Department of\nHomeland Security.\nNote that this requirement is for the student to submit a FAFSA form. It is not a requirement for the parent borrower to\nsubmit a FAFSA form in the parent9s name, and it does not preclude an otherwise eligible parent whose information is not\nincluded on the FAFSA form (sometimes referred to as a <non-custodial= parent) from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan.\nBefore originating a Direct PLUS Loan for a parent borrower, schools must review the ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary\nof the dependent student to ensure there are no student eligibility issues that must be resolved before the parent can\nreceive the Direct PLUS Loan.\nAdverse Credit History\nAn individual with an adverse credit history is prohibited from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan unless they meet additional\neligibility requirements. The Department obtains a credit report on each student or parent applicant for a Direct PLUS\nLoan. An applicant is considered to have an adverse credit history if:\nThey have one or more debts with a total combined outstanding balance greater than $2,085 that (1) are 90 or more\ndays delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or (2) have been placed in collection or charged-off during the two\nyears preceding the date of the credit report; or\nDuring the five years preceding the date of the credit report, the applicant has been determined to be in default on a\ndebt; has had debts discharged in bankruptcy; or has been the subject of foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage\ngarnishment, or write-off of a Title IV debt.\nFor Direct PLUS Loan eligibility purposes, <charged-off= means a debt that has been written off as a loss, but that is still\nsubject to collection action. <In collection= means a debt that has been placed with a collection agency by a creditor or\nthat is subject to more intensive efforts by a creditor to recover amounts owed from a borrower who has not responded\nsatisfactorily to the routine demands of the creditor9s billing procedures.\nAn applicant cannot be denied a Direct PLUS Loan because they have no credit history. That is, the absence of a credit\nhistory is not considered to be adverse credit.\nThere are two means by which a Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit history can still qualify for a Direct\nPLUS Loan. One option is for the applicant to obtain an endorser who doesn9t have an adverse credit history. An endorser\nis someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower doesn9t repay it. For a parent borrower, the\nendorser may not be the dependent student for whom the parent is borrowing.\nAs an alternative to obtaining an endorser, an applicant who has been determined to have an adverse credit history may\nalso qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan by submitting documentation to the Department showing that there are extenuating\ncircumstances associated with the adverse credit. The Department has the final decision on determining whether\nextenuating circumstances exist.\nA borrower who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting to the satisfaction of the\nDepartment that extenuating circumstances exist must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling, as discussed below.', 'information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form\nIf you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information\nsections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the\nstudent, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up\nto the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent\nsecond-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume\nfor information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of\nthe other Title IV programs.\nSelf-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or\nhave refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated\nstatement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students\nwithout parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide.\nDirect PLUS Loans\nDirect PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate\nstudents.\nA parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who\nmeets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a\nstudent. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is\nineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent\nwho had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements\noutlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal\ngovernment holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s\nineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student\nis otherwise eligible.\nRequirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers\nSchools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan\nProgram and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available\nto both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students. For more information, see the\ndiscussion under <Direct PLUS Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDefinition of <Parent= for Direct PLUS Loan Purposes\nIf they meet all other Direct PLUS Loan eligibility requirements, the following individuals can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on\nbehalf of a dependent undergraduate student:\nThe student9s biological parent;\nThe student9s legal adoptive parent; or\nThe student9s stepparent (spouse of the student9s biological or legal adoptive parent at the time of application), but\nonly if the stepparent is required to provide their information on the FAFSA form in accordance with the instructions\non the FAFSA form.\nGrandparents and other family members are not eligible to take out Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent\nundergraduate student unless they have legally adopted the student.\nIn addition to the parent(s) whose resources are reported on a student9s FAFSA form, any otherwise eligible biological or\nlegal adoptive parent of the dependent undergraduate student can also take out a Direct PLUS Loan on the student9s\nbehalf, even if that parent9s information is not reported on the FAFSA form.\nNote also that more than one parent can take out a Direct PLUS Loan on behalf of the same dependent undergraduate', 'If your school participates in the Direct PLUS program but a student9s parent cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the\nstudent is allowed to borrow additional unsubsidized funds (see <Criteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan Funds= in Chapter 4 of this volume).\nRequired Counseling for Direct PLUS Loan Applicants With Adverse Credit\nAny student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has an adverse credit history but qualifies by obtaining an endorser\nor documenting that there are extenuating circumstances must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling on the\nDepartment9s StudentAid.gov website.\nAdverse Credit History and Default\nAlthough a default on a Title IV loan will generally appear in a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant9s credit record\nand result in the individual being determined to have an adverse credit history, being in default on a Title IV loan and\nhaving an adverse credit history are separate eligibility issues. A Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified through the\nDepartment9s National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as being in default on a Title IV loan and who has also been\ndetermined to have an adverse credit history (due to the default and/or other adverse credit conditions) cannot qualify for\na Direct PLUS Loan simply by obtaining an endorser or by providing acceptable documentation of extenuating\ncircumstances. The applicant must also separately resolve the default status by one of the means discussed under\n<Resolving Default Status= in Volume 1, Chapter 3.\nIn some cases, the Direct PLUS Loan credit check may not reveal a default on a Title IV loan, particularly if the default is\nnot recent. If a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified in NSLDS as being in default on a Title IV\nloan does not have any other adverse credit issues, the applicant will pass the PLUS credit check. In this circumstance you\ncannot assume that the approved credit check result supersedes the information in NSLDS. The default must be resolved\nbefore you can disburse Direct PLUS Loan funds or other Title IV aid to the applicant.\nDirect PLUS Loan Application\nSchools that offer Direct PLUS Loans have the option of requiring student and parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants to\ncomplete the Direct PLUS Loan Application (formally known as the ""Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request for Supplemental\nInformation"") on the Department\'s StudentAid.gov website as the first step in applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. The Direct\nPLUS Loan Application collects the requested loan amount, the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended, and\nother information related to processing the requested Direct PLUS Loan.\nUse of the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov is not required. Schools may choose to develop their own\nprocesses for obtaining the information needed to originate Direct PLUS Loans.\nAlthough the Department9s FAFSA Processing System (FPS) matches student Direct PLUS Loan applicants against NSLDS\nto determine if they are in default on a Title IV loan, it does not perform this match for parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants.\nHowever, the Department conducts an NSLDS default check on all Direct PLUS Loan applicants (both students and\nparents) who complete the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov.\nSchools that use the Direct PLUS Loan Application are notified of the result of the NSLDS default check through the\nCommon Origination and Disbursement (COD) System. The result is reported as one of the following values:\n""N"" = The borrower is not in default on any Title IV loan.\nDefinition of <Adverse Credit History=\n34 CFR 685.200(c)(2)(viii)(B)\n34 CFR 685.200(b)(5)', 'Exit Counseling\nA Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan borrower who is graduating, leaving\nschool, or dropping below half-time enrollment is required to complete exit counseling. If the student withdraws without\nnotifying your school, you must confirm that they have completed online counseling or mail exit counseling material to\nthe student at their last known address. You may also email the information to the student9s home (not school) email\naddress if you have it. The PDF version of the Direct Loan Exit Counseling Guide satisfies this requirement. You may also\nsend the student a direct link to the exit counseling materials online. Whatever method you choose must be used within\n30 days of learning that the borrower has withdrawn or failed to participate in an exit counseling session.\nWhen mailing exit materials to a student who has left school, you9re not required to use certified mail with a return receipt\nrequested, but you must document in their file that the materials were sent.

The FAFSA Simplification Act eliminated this provision. Beginning with the 2024-2025 award year, when packaging aid for any period that is not nine months, schools must use a student9s calculated 9-month SAI in the formula to determine eligibility for need-based aid, as described above (that is, COA 3 SAI 3 OFA = need). As a result of this change, students who are enrolled for periods shorter than nine months will have less financial need than would have been the case in the past when using an alternate (smaller) EFC for such periods. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more information on how this change may affect Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for students receiving loans for periods of enrollment (loan periods) shorter than nine months. Treatment of Negative SAIs A student may have a calculated SAI that is a negative number as low as -1,500. Also, as explained in Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide, certain students will automatically receive a -1,500 SAI. When packaging need-based aid for students with negative SAIs, schools must convert any negative SAIs to zero for awarding purposes. This means that a negative SAI will not increase the amount of need-based aid a student can receive. Note that a negative SAI also does not increase the amount of non-need-based aid that a student may receive because the SAI is not a factor in determining eligibility for aid that isn9t based on financial need. Packaging Rules Pell Grants as the First Source of Aid Pell Grants are the first source of aid for a student, and packaging Title IV funds begins with determining a student9s Pell Grant eligibility, as described in Volume 7. A correctly determined Pell Grant is never adjusted to take into account other forms of aid. When awarding aid from the other Title IV programs, you must ensure that the student9s need or COA is not exceeded. In some cases, a student9s aid package may include a Pell Grant and non-Title IV aid (for example, institutional aid or private education loans), but no other types of Title IV aid, and the combination of the Pell Grant and the other aid may be large enough to exceed the student9s COA. For instance, the National Collegiate Athletic Association9s (NCAA's) rules for athletic aid may permit a school to award athletic aid that covers a student9s full COA (see <NCAA Considerations= in Chapter 2 of this volume for more information). In this case, the student is still eligible for the full amount of the Pell Grant. However, you can9t award any Title IV funds other than the Pell Grant. Note that in some cases a student9s SAI may be higher than the COA, resulting in no financial need, but the student may still qualify for a calculated Pell Grant or a minimum Pell Grant (see Volume 7, Chapter 2 for more information on Pell Grant eligibility criteria). As an example, consider a student with an SAI of 6,650, a COA of $5,500, and a calculated Pell Grant amount of $745. In this circumstance the student is still eligible for the full Pell Grant amount (as long as it doesn9t exceed the COA), but you may not award any other types of need-based Title IV aid. If a student9s aid package includes a Pell Grant, other types of Title IV aid, and non-Title IV aid, and the total aid amount exceeds the student9s COA, the student still qualifies for the full Pell Grant amount, but you must adjust the other Title IV aid to ensure that the COA is not exceeded. In the circumstances described above you may (but are not required to) adjust non-Title IV aid over which you have control in accordance with your school9s policies."", '<2-hop>\n\nVerification Following Disasters The Dear Colleague Letter GEN-17-08 gives general guidance for awarding aid in federally declared disasters. It states that the Secretary will not enforce the verification requirements during the award year for applicants whose records were lost or destroyed because of a disaster if the school has tried to preserve and reconstruct any records. The school must document when it does not perform verification for this reason and use status code <S= when reporting the disbursement of Pell Grants to affected students. Also, the requirement for dependent students to submit a statement signed by a parent regarding family size is waived if the parents cannot provide the signature due to the disaster. The school must note why no parent was able to provide the statement. Schools that experience a local disaster (rather than a federally declared one) that affects Title IV administration should consult their regional school participation division. Acceptable Documentation The FAFSA Simplification Act requires that, wherever possible, the Department use data received directly from the IRS to calculate a student9s SAI and Pell Grant award. The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act (FUTURE Act) requires the Department of Education to access tax information held by the IRS pertaining to FAFSA applicants4and, where applicable, their parents and spouses4through a secure method: the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX). The FUTURE Act amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to mandate the disclosure of FTI directly from the IRS to the Department with an individual9s consent and approval. The FUTURE Act also made providing consent and approval for the exchange of FTI a requirement for receiving federal student aid. Applicants and contributors will be required to provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI directly from the IRS. When FTI is received from the IRS via the FA-DDX, the FTI received is considered verified and no additional documentation is necessary. As a result, the FA-DDX is the fastest, easiest, and most secure method of meeting income and tax verification requirements. The September 4, 2024 Federal Register Notice gives the documentation required for verifying 2025-26 application data, which depends on the item verified, as explained in this section. If you use a verification document, be sure that it is signed, that all required sections are completed, and that any relevant tax or alternative documents are attached. Copies of original documents are acceptable. An original signature on an original document, an original signature on a copy of a document, and a copy of a document with an original signature on it are all valid signatures, unless specifically noted in this chapter. If a copy of the tax return is used, the filer (or at least one of the filers of a joint return) must sign it or the tax preparer must provide their name and SSN, EIN, or PTIN. Suggested Verification Text The Department has developed suggested text that you may use to create a verification document and to verify non-tax items, such as family size. To review the suggested text for 2025-26, please see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10. The suggested text fulfills verification requirements, but schools do not have to use it, except as noted below. Instead, they may develop and use their own (or someone else9s) text, forms, documents, statements, and certifications that are specific to the items required to be verified for a particular student or group of students at the school. However, schools they tried to locate their estranged spouse. The school determines that the student doesn9t need to verify their spouse9s tax and income information. However, the student must still verify their own information. The school may also choose to use professional judgment to remove the spouse9s information from the student9s FAFSA form.']","The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the impact of the FAFSA Simplification Act on the calculation of student aid for periods shorter than nine months, nor does it detail the role of the FUTURE Act in verifying income and tax information for FAFSA applicants.

Before originating a Direct Loan, a\nschool must determine the student9s or parent9s eligibility for the loan. For each Direct Loan that a school disburses to a\nstudent or parent, the school must submit a loan award record to the COD System that includes the student9s grade level,\nthe loan period and academic year dates, the loan amount, the anticipated and actual dates and amounts of the loan\ndisbursements, and other information. Submission of a loan award record serves as the school9s certification that it has\ndetermined the borrower9s eligibility for the loan.\nThe specific Direct Loan amount that a student or parent borrower is eligible to receive is determined based on various\nfactors such as the student9s COA, Student Aid Index (SAI), OFA, and remaining eligibility under the annual and aggregate\nloan limits (see Chapter 4 for guidance on annual and aggregate loan limits). Some of these factors are relevant only\nwhen determining eligibility for certain types of Direct Loans. When originating a Direct Loan, the COA used in\ndetermining the loan amount may include only those costs associated with the period of enrollment (loan period) for\nwhich the loan is being originated.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans have annual and aggregate limits that are the same for all\nstudents at a given grade level and dependency status. You may not originate a Direct Loan for an amount that:\nExceeds the amount requested by the borrower;\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus the student9s SAI and OFA;\nIn the case of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan or Direct PLUS Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus OFA; or\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, would cause the student to exceed the annual or\naggregate limit.\nSee Volume 3, Chapter 3 for more information on packaging Direct Loans as part of a student9s financial aid award.\nOriginating a Loan\nIt9s important to remember that your school, not the Department, is responsible for determining a borrower9s eligibility for\na Direct Loan. Schools that originate and disburse loans to ineligible borrowers, or for loan amounts that exceed loan\nlimits or financial need, are subject to administrative actions such as a fine, limitation, suspension, and termination, as\nwell as liabilities including repayment to the government of interest and costs it has paid on the ineligible loans.\nYou must originate a Direct Loan while the student is enrolled and eligible for the period of enrollment for which the loan\nis intended. You may not originate a loan for a period in which the student is no longer enrolled. For example, you may\nnot originate a loan for a prior academic year that has ended, even if the student is enrolled and eligible for the current\nacademic year.

The key features of Direct Subsidized Loans include:

1. **Eligibility**: Only students with financial need can receive these loans. To qualify, students must be enrolled at least half-time in a school that participates in the Direct Loan Program and meet general federal student aid eligibility requirements.

2. **Interest Benefits**: The federal government does not charge interest on Direct Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time, during grace periods, deferment periods, and certain repayment periods that are based on the borrower's income and family size.

3. **Loan Amounts**: If a student is determined to have a financial need for a Direct Subsidized Loan of $200 or less, the school may opt not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.

4. **Loan Limits**: Direct Subsidized Loans have specific annual and aggregate limits based on the student's grade level and dependency status.

In summary, Direct Subsidized Loans are designed to help eligible undergraduate students finance their education without accruing interest during certain periods, making them a beneficial option for those who qualify based on financial need.","The context does not provide specific information about Direct Subsidized Loans, but it mentions that dependent undergraduate students whose parents refuse to complete the FAFSA form or have ended financial support may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans.",0.5,1.0,0.0,0.9457671626285307,0.6666666644444444,0.6470588235294118,contextual_compression_rag
"What role does the Cost of Attendance (COA) play in determining a student's financial aid eligibility, and how are allowable costs factored into this calculation?","['Chapter 3\nDirect Loan Origination, Loan Periods, and Disbursements\nOrigination Overview\nOrigination is the process of creating a Direct Loan award in the school9s system. Before originating a Direct Loan, a\nschool must determine the student9s or parent9s eligibility for the loan. For each Direct Loan that a school disburses to a\nstudent or parent, the school must submit a loan award record to the COD System that includes the student9s grade level,\nthe loan period and academic year dates, the loan amount, the anticipated and actual dates and amounts of the loan\ndisbursements, and other information. Submission of a loan award record serves as the school9s certification that it has\ndetermined the borrower9s eligibility for the loan.\nThe specific Direct Loan amount that a student or parent borrower is eligible to receive is determined based on various\nfactors such as the student9s COA, Student Aid Index (SAI), OFA, and remaining eligibility under the annual and aggregate\nloan limits (see Chapter 4 for guidance on annual and aggregate loan limits). Some of these factors are relevant only\nwhen determining eligibility for certain types of Direct Loans. When originating a Direct Loan, the COA used in\ndetermining the loan amount may include only those costs associated with the period of enrollment (loan period) for\nwhich the loan is being originated.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans have annual and aggregate limits that are the same for all\nstudents at a given grade level and dependency status. You may not originate a Direct Loan for an amount that:\nExceeds the amount requested by the borrower;\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus the student9s SAI and OFA;\nIn the case of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan or Direct PLUS Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus OFA; or\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, would cause the student to exceed the annual or\naggregate limit.\nSee Volume 3, Chapter 3 for more information on packaging Direct Loans as part of a student9s financial aid award.\nOriginating a Loan\nIt9s important to remember that your school, not the Department, is responsible for determining a borrower9s eligibility for\na Direct Loan. Schools that originate and disburse loans to ineligible borrowers, or for loan amounts that exceed loan\nlimits or financial need, are subject to administrative actions such as a fine, limitation, suspension, and termination, as\nwell as liabilities including repayment to the government of interest and costs it has paid on the ineligible loans.\nYou must originate a Direct Loan while the student is enrolled and eligible for the period of enrollment for which the loan\nis intended. You may not originate a loan for a period in which the student is no longer enrolled. For example, you may\nnot originate a loan for a prior academic year that has ended, even if the student is enrolled and eligible for the current\nacademic year. Similarly, if a student who was enrolled at least half time only for the fall and spring quarters of an\nacademic year consisting of fall, winter, and spring quarters does not request a loan until the spring, you may not at that\ntime originate a loan for the previous fall quarter.\nFor all Direct Loans, you must document the student9s COA, SAI, and OFA in the student9s file.

If\nthe student is receiving Direct Subsidized Loans or Direct Unsubsidized Loans, the schools that the student is attending\nare responsible for coordinating to make sure that the total amount of the loans the student receives does not exceed the\napplicable annual or aggregate loan limit. In addition, the schools must ensure that there is no duplication of non-\ninstitutional costs when determining the student9s COA. Note that in the situation where a student is concurrently enrolled\nand eligible at more than one school, which is different than the consortium arrangements discussed in Volume 2, Chapter\n2, loan funds awarded at one school are not to be included as OFA by any other school the student is attending when\ndetermining the student9s loan eligibility for the same period.\nExceptions to the <Regular Student= Requirement for Direct Loans\nAs explained in Volume 1, Chapter 1, one of the eligibility requirements for a student to receive Title IV aid is that the\nstudent must be enrolled at an eligible school for the purpose of obtaining a degree or certificate offered by the school.\nSuch a student is known as a <regular student.= However, there are two limited exceptions to this requirement for Direct\nLoans: preparatory coursework and teacher certification coursework.\nPreparatory Coursework\nA student may receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan (or a parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan\non behalf of a dependent student) for preparatory coursework that the school has documented is necessary for the\nstudent to enroll in an eligible program. The preparatory courses must be offered as part of an eligible program offered by\nthe school, though the student does not have to be enrolled in that program. A school may not award Direct Loans for\nstandalone courses that do not count towards an eligible program and exist solely to serve as preparatory coursework.\nA student who is enrolled at least half time in preparatory coursework as described above is eligible to receive loans for a\nmaximum of one consecutive 12-month period (not per program) beginning on the first day of the loan period. If the\nconsecutive 12-month period of preparatory coursework spans more than one academic year, the student may receive\nmore than one annual loan limit.\nTo be eligible for loans under this exception, the student must be taking classes that are a prerequisite for admission.

Unlike scholarship programs that may award funds based on academic merit or the student9s field of study, <need-based= grants, loans, and work-study are based on the student9s demonstrated financial need for assistance. The cost of attendance (COA) is the cornerstone of establishing a student9s financial need, as it sets a limit on the total aid that a student may receive for purposes of the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, and is one of the basic components of the Pell Grant calculation. This chapter picks up at the point where the Student Aid Index (SAI) for a student has been determined. See Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide for more information on the SAI, and Volume 1 for more information on basic student eligibility requirements. Most schools establish average costs for different categories of students and set these cost categories in EDExpress or other software that they use to determine awards and package aid. The typical costs that you establish for your students will be used to calculate their Title IV award amounts and package their aid.', '<2-hop>\n\nAllowable Costs The HEA specifies the types of costs that are included in the COA, but each school must determine the appropriate and reasonable amounts to include for each eligible COA category for its students, based on the criteria described in this chapter. The COA for a student is an estimate of that student9s educational expenses for the period of enrollment. As you9ll see, in most cases you can use average expenses (for students with the same enrollment status) at your school, rather than actual expenses. For example, for the tuition and fees component, you can use the same average amount for all full-time students instead of figuring the actual tuition and fees for each individual student. You can have different standard costs for different categories of students, such as one COA for out-of-state students, who are charged higher tuition, and a different COA for in-state students, who are charged lower tuition. However, you cannot combine the COA figures for each separate enrollment status and award aid to a student based on the average COA. Students must be awarded based on a COA comprised of allowable costs assessed all students carrying the same academic workload. If a student is enrolled in a program that has extra fees or costs, such as lab fees, you can add those fees to the student9s cost or use a standard cost that you9ve established for all students in that program. If you establish standard cost categories, you must apply the cost allowances uniformly to all students in those categories. There are a variety of methods to arrive at average costs for your students, such as conducting periodic surveys of your student population, assessing local housing costs or other pertinent data, or other reasonable methods you may devise which generate accurate average costs for various categories of students. The types of costs that may be included are the same for all Title IV programs. For the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, the COA, based on the student9s enrollment status, is a student9s cost for the period for which the aid is intended. For Pell Grants, the COA is always the full-year costs for a full-time student, so you may have to prorate actual or average costs up for students who are attending less than an academic year (or who are less than full time in a term-based program) or prorate down for students who are attending for periods longer than an academic year. Note that though certain components are excluded from the Pell Grant COA for a student who is enrolled on a less-than-half-time basis, the components that are included in the less-than-half-time Pell Grant COA are still based on the full-year costs for a full-time student for a Pell Grant recipient with an enrollment intensity below 50%. See Volume 7 for guidance on Pell Grant requirements. The types of costs included in the COA are determined by section 472 of the HEA and are the only costs that may be included in a student9s COA. If a cost is not listed below, it may not be included as part of the COA. Unless it is specifically noted in the discussion of COA categories below that a particular category applies only to students who are enrolled at least half time, the types of expenses that may be included in the COA are the same for all students, regardless of enrollment status.']","The Cost of Attendance (COA) plays a crucial role in determining a student's financial aid eligibility, particularly for Direct Loans under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. The COA represents the total estimated cost of attending a postsecondary institution, which includes tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and other related expenses.

When assessing a student's eligibility for Direct Loans, the COA is used in conjunction with other factors such as the Student Aid Index (SAI) and any other financial aid the student may be receiving (referred to as Other Financial Aid or OFA). Specifically, the amount a student can borrow through Direct Subsidized Loans is limited to the COA minus the SAI and OFA. For Direct Unsubsidized Loans or Direct PLUS Loans, the limit is the COA minus OFA.

Allowable costs factored into the COA calculation include only those expenses that are directly associated with the period of enrollment for which the loan is being originated. This means that schools must ensure that the COA reflects the actual costs incurred during the specific loan period, and they must avoid duplicating non-institutional costs when determining the COA for students who are concurrently enrolled at multiple institutions.

In summary, the COA is essential for calculating the maximum loan amount a student can receive, ensuring that the financial aid awarded does not exceed the student's demonstrated financial need.","The Cost of Attendance (COA) is crucial in determining a student's financial aid eligibility as it sets a limit on the total aid a student may receive for programs like Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs. It is a fundamental component in calculating a student's financial need, which is necessary for awarding need-based grants, loans, and work-study. The COA is an estimate of a student's educational expenses for the enrollment period and includes allowable costs as specified by the Higher Education Act (HEA). Schools must determine appropriate and reasonable amounts for each COA category based on criteria such as enrollment status and may use average expenses for students with similar enrollment statuses. Allowable costs are standardized and must be applied uniformly to all students within the same category, ensuring that aid is awarded based on a COA comprised of these allowable costs.",1.0,1.0,0.43,0.9452602070696058,0.06666666662222222,0.5384615384615384,contextual_compression_rag

This chapter discusses other eligibility requirements that are\nspecific to the Direct Loan Program.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\nOnly students who have financial need may receive Direct Subsidized Loans. The federal government does not charge\ninterest on Direct Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled on at least a half-time basis, during the grace and\ndeferment periods, and during certain other periods (for example, during certain periods of repayment under certain\nrepayment plans that determine the required monthly payment amount based on the borrower9s income and family size).\nIf a student has received a determination of need for a Direct Subsidized Loan in an amount of $200 or less, a school may\nchoose not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and may instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan.\nFinancial need is not an eligibility requirement to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.

The FAFSA Simplification Act eliminated this provision. Beginning with the 2024-2025 award year, when packaging aid for any period that is not nine months, schools must use a student9s calculated 9-month SAI in the formula to determine eligibility for need-based aid, as described above (that is, COA 3 SAI 3 OFA = need). As a result of this change, students who are enrolled for periods shorter than nine months will have less financial need than would have been the case in the past when using an alternate (smaller) EFC for such periods. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more information on how this change may affect Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for students receiving loans for periods of enrollment (loan periods) shorter than nine months. Treatment of Negative SAIs A student may have a calculated SAI that is a negative number as low as -1,500. Also, as explained in Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide, certain students will automatically receive a -1,500 SAI. When packaging need-based aid for students with negative SAIs, schools must convert any negative SAIs to zero for awarding purposes. This means that a negative SAI will not increase the amount of need-based aid a student can receive. Note that a negative SAI also does not increase the amount of non-need-based aid that a student may receive because the SAI is not a factor in determining eligibility for aid that isn9t based on financial need. Packaging Rules Pell Grants as the First Source of Aid Pell Grants are the first source of aid for a student, and packaging Title IV funds begins with determining a student9s Pell Grant eligibility, as described in Volume 7. A correctly determined Pell Grant is never adjusted to take into account other forms of aid. When awarding aid from the other Title IV programs, you must ensure that the student9s need or COA is not exceeded. In some cases, a student9s aid package may include a Pell Grant and non-Title IV aid (for example, institutional aid or private education loans), but no other types of Title IV aid, and the combination of the Pell Grant and the other aid may be large enough to exceed the student9s COA. For instance, the National Collegiate Athletic Association9s (NCAA's) rules for athletic aid may permit a school to award athletic aid that covers a student9s full COA (see <NCAA Considerations= in Chapter 2 of this volume for more information). In this case, the student is still eligible for the full amount of the Pell Grant. However, you can9t award any Title IV funds other than the Pell Grant. Note that in some cases a student9s SAI may be higher than the COA, resulting in no financial need, but the student may still qualify for a calculated Pell Grant or a minimum Pell Grant (see Volume 7, Chapter 2 for more information on Pell Grant eligibility criteria). As an example, consider a student with an SAI of 6,650, a COA of $5,500, and a calculated Pell Grant amount of $745. In this circumstance the student is still eligible for the full Pell Grant amount (as long as it doesn9t exceed the COA), but you may not award any other types of need-based Title IV aid. If a student9s aid package includes a Pell Grant, other types of Title IV aid, and non-Title IV aid, and the total aid amount exceeds the student9s COA, the student still qualifies for the full Pell Grant amount, but you must adjust the other Title IV aid to ensure that the COA is not exceeded. In the circumstances described above you may (but are not required to) adjust non-Title IV aid over which you have control in accordance with your school9s policies."", '<2-hop>\n\nVerification Following Disasters The Dear Colleague Letter GEN-17-08 gives general guidance for awarding aid in federally declared disasters. It states that the Secretary will not enforce the verification requirements during the award year for applicants whose records were lost or destroyed because of a disaster if the school has tried to preserve and reconstruct any records. The school must document when it does not perform verification for this reason and use status code <S= when reporting the disbursement of Pell Grants to affected students. Also, the requirement for dependent students to submit a statement signed by a parent regarding family size is waived if the parents cannot provide the signature due to the disaster. The school must note why no parent was able to provide the statement. Schools that experience a local disaster (rather than a federally declared one) that affects Title IV administration should consult their regional school participation division. Acceptable Documentation The FAFSA Simplification Act requires that, wherever possible, the Department use data received directly from the IRS to calculate a student9s SAI and Pell Grant award. The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act (FUTURE Act) requires the Department of Education to access tax information held by the IRS pertaining to FAFSA applicants4and, where applicable, their parents and spouses4through a secure method: the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX). The FUTURE Act amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to mandate the disclosure of FTI directly from the IRS to the Department with an individual9s consent and approval. The FUTURE Act also made providing consent and approval for the exchange of FTI a requirement for receiving federal student aid. Applicants and contributors will be required to provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI directly from the IRS. When FTI is received from the IRS via the FA-DDX, the FTI received is considered verified and no additional documentation is necessary. As a result, the FA-DDX is the fastest, easiest, and most secure method of meeting income and tax verification requirements. The September 4, 2024 Federal Register Notice gives the documentation required for verifying 2025-26 application data, which depends on the item verified, as explained in this section. If you use a verification document, be sure that it is signed, that all required sections are completed, and that any relevant tax or alternative documents are attached. Copies of original documents are acceptable. An original signature on an original document, an original signature on a copy of a document, and a copy of a document with an original signature on it are all valid signatures, unless specifically noted in this chapter. If a copy of the tax return is used, the filer (or at least one of the filers of a joint return) must sign it or the tax preparer must provide their name and SSN, EIN, or PTIN. Suggested Verification Text The Department has developed suggested text that you may use to create a verification document and to verify non-tax items, such as family size. To review the suggested text for 2025-26, please see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10. The suggested text fulfills verification requirements, but schools do not have to use it, except as noted below. Instead, they may develop and use their own (or someone else9s) text, forms, documents, statements, and certifications that are specific to the items required to be verified for a particular student or group of students at the school. However, schools they tried to locate their estranged spouse. The school determines that the student doesn9t need to verify their spouse9s tax and income information. However, the student must still verify their own information. The school may also choose to use professional judgment to remove the spouse9s information from the student9s FAFSA form.']","The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the impact of the FAFSA Simplification Act on the calculation of student aid for periods shorter than nine months, nor does it detail the role of the FUTURE Act in verifying income and tax information for FAFSA applicants. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to your question based on the available context. If you have access to additional information or documents, I would be happy to help analyze that content.","The FAFSA Simplification Act impacts the calculation of student aid for periods shorter than nine months by eliminating the provision that allowed schools to use alternate expected family contributions (EFCs). Starting with the 2024-2025 award year, schools must use a student's calculated 9-month Student Aid Index (SAI) in the formula to determine eligibility for need-based aid, which may result in students having less financial need for periods shorter than nine months. The FUTURE Act plays a role in verifying income and tax information for FAFSA applicants by requiring the Department of Education to access tax information directly from the IRS through the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX). This method is considered the fastest, easiest, and most secure for meeting income and tax verification requirements, as it allows the Department to use verified data received directly from the IRS without needing additional documentation.",0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,contextual_compression_rag
What are Direct Subsidized Loans?,"['Chapter 1\nStudent and Parent Eligibility for Direct Loans\nOverview\nTo be eligible for Direct Loans, a student must be enrolled on at least a half-time basis at a school that participates in the\nDirect Loan Program, and students and parents must meet the general federal student aid eligibility requirements\ncovered in Volume 1 of the Federal Student Aid Handbook. This chapter discusses other eligibility requirements that are\nspecific to the Direct Loan Program.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\nOnly students who have financial need may receive Direct Subsidized Loans. The federal government does not charge\ninterest on Direct Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled on at least a half-time basis, during the grace and\ndeferment periods, and during certain other periods (for example, during certain periods of repayment under certain\nrepayment plans that determine the required monthly payment amount based on the borrower9s income and family size).\nIf a student has received a determination of need for a Direct Subsidized Loan in an amount of $200 or less, a school may\nchoose not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and may instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan.\nFinancial need is not an eligibility requirement to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. The federal government generally\ncharges interest on Direct Unsubsidized Loans during all periods, with limited exceptions (for example, during periods of\ndeferment for cancer treatment).\nTo be eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, an undergraduate student attending a\nschool that participates in the Federal Pell Grant Program must first have received a determination of their Pell Grant\neligibility for the period of enrollment for which the student is requesting a loan.\nNo Minimum Age To Receive a Direct Loan\nStudents who are minors may receive Direct Loans, but they may not refuse to repay the loans based on a <defense of\ninfancy= (that is, by claiming that they were too young to enter into the contract of signing the promissory note).\nRequirement To Offer Both Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans\nDirect Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are two components of a single loan program. A school may not choose\nto make only Direct Subsidized Loans or only Direct Unsubsidized Loans available to its eligible students.

A school may not award Direct Loans for\nstandalone courses that do not count towards an eligible program and exist solely to serve as preparatory coursework.\nA student who is enrolled at least half time in preparatory coursework as described above is eligible to receive loans for a\nmaximum of one consecutive 12-month period (not per program) beginning on the first day of the loan period. If the\nconsecutive 12-month period of preparatory coursework spans more than one academic year, the student may receive\nmore than one annual loan limit.\nTo be eligible for loans under this exception, the student must be taking classes that are a prerequisite for admission. A\nstudent who is only taking courses to raise their grade-point average in order to be admitted does not qualify.\nPreparatory Coursework at a Different School\nRegular Student\n34 CFR 600.2\nPreparatory Coursework\n34 CFR 668.32(a)(1)(ii)\n34 CFR 685.203(a)(6) and (c)(2)(vi)', 'Chapter 3\nDirect Loan Origination, Loan Periods, and Disbursements\nOrigination Overview\nOrigination is the process of creating a Direct Loan award in the school9s system. Before originating a Direct Loan, a\nschool must determine the student9s or parent9s eligibility for the loan. For each Direct Loan that a school disburses to a\nstudent or parent, the school must submit a loan award record to the COD System that includes the student9s grade level,\nthe loan period and academic year dates, the loan amount, the anticipated and actual dates and amounts of the loan\ndisbursements, and other information. Submission of a loan award record serves as the school9s certification that it has\ndetermined the borrower9s eligibility for the loan.\nThe specific Direct Loan amount that a student or parent borrower is eligible to receive is determined based on various\nfactors such as the student9s COA, Student Aid Index (SAI), OFA, and remaining eligibility under the annual and aggregate\nloan limits (see Chapter 4 for guidance on annual and aggregate loan limits). Some of these factors are relevant only\nwhen determining eligibility for certain types of Direct Loans. When originating a Direct Loan, the COA used in\ndetermining the loan amount may include only those costs associated with the period of enrollment (loan period) for\nwhich the loan is being originated.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans have annual and aggregate limits that are the same for all\nstudents at a given grade level and dependency status. You may not originate a Direct Loan for an amount that:\nExceeds the amount requested by the borrower;\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus the student9s SAI and OFA;\nIn the case of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan or Direct PLUS Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus OFA; or\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, would cause the student to exceed the annual or\naggregate limit.\nSee Volume 3, Chapter 3 for more information on packaging Direct Loans as part of a student9s financial aid award.\nOriginating a Loan\nIt9s important to remember that your school, not the Department, is responsible for determining a borrower9s eligibility for\na Direct Loan. Schools that originate and disburse loans to ineligible borrowers, or for loan amounts that exceed loan\nlimits or financial need, are subject to administrative actions such as a fine, limitation, suspension, and termination, as\nwell as liabilities including repayment to the government of interest and costs it has paid on the ineligible loans.\nYou must originate a Direct Loan while the student is enrolled and eligible for the period of enrollment for which the loan\nis intended. You may not originate a loan for a period in which the student is no longer enrolled. For example, you may\nnot originate a loan for a prior academic year that has ended, even if the student is enrolled and eligible for the current\nacademic year. Similarly, if a student who was enrolled at least half time only for the fall and spring quarters of an\nacademic year consisting of fall, winter, and spring quarters does not request a loan until the spring, you may not at that\ntime originate a loan for the previous fall quarter.\nFor all Direct Loans, you must document the student9s COA, SAI, and OFA in the student9s file. This information must be\nmade available to the Department upon request.\nYou must confirm that the borrower meets the definition of eligible borrower by doing the following:\nDetermine that the student is enrolled at least half time and making satisfactory academic progress (see Volume 1);\nReview the NSLDS information on the ISIR or the NSLDS Professional Access website to ensure that the student is not\nin default, does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant or loan (see Volume 1), and will not exceed the annual or\naggregate loan limits (as described in Chapter 4 of this volume);\nEnsure that the amount of the loan, in combination with other aid, will not exceed the student9s financial need or', 'Volume 8\nThe Direct Loan Program\nIntroduction\nUnder the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loan Program), the U.S. Department of Education (the\nDepartment) makes loans to help students and parents pay the cost of attendance (COA) at a postsecondary school. This\nvolume of the Federal Student Aid Handbook provides information to assist schools in determining student and parent\neligibility for Direct Loans, counseling student borrowers, and awarding Direct Loans.\nChanges for 2025-2026\nWe have made the following changes in Volume 8 for 2025-2026:\nIn Chapter 3, we have revised the discussion of loan periods to provide a limited exception to the longstanding\nrequirement that the loan period for a Direct Loan may not include any terms in which the borrower is ineligible to\nreceive Direct Loan funds.\nAlso in Chapter 3, we have added a slightly revised and expanded version of guidance on the treatment of Direct\nLoan disbursements made after the date of a borrower9s death that was previously in Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the FSA\nHandbook under the heading <Checking Eligibility at the Time of Disbursement.= Because this guidance is specific to\nDirect Loans, we believe Volume 8 is a more appropriate location.\nIn Chapter 5, we have revised Example 6 to reflect the limited exception to the requirement that a loan period may\nnot include terms in which the borrower is ineligible (see Chapter 3 changes above).\nIn Chapter 7, we have revised the discussion of transfer students and abbreviated loan periods to clarify that in some\ncircumstances a transfer student may be eligible to receive more Direct Loan funds for the program at the new\nschool than a non-transfer student would be eligible to receive for that same program.\nExcept as noted above, there are no other substantive changes to Volume 8 for 2025-2026.', 'information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form\nIf you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information\nsections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the\nstudent, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up\nto the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent\nsecond-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume\nfor information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of\nthe other Title IV programs.\nSelf-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or\nhave refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated\nstatement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students\nwithout parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide.\nDirect PLUS Loans\nDirect PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate\nstudents.\nA parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who\nmeets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a\nstudent. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is\nineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent\nwho had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements\noutlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal\ngovernment holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s\nineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student\nis otherwise eligible.\nRequirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers\nSchools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan\nProgram and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available\nto both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students. For more information, see the\ndiscussion under <Direct PLUS Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDefinition of <Parent= for Direct PLUS Loan Purposes\nIf they meet all other Direct PLUS Loan eligibility requirements, the following individuals can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on\nbehalf of a dependent undergraduate student:\nThe student9s biological parent;\nThe student9s legal adoptive parent; or\nThe student9s stepparent (spouse of the student9s biological or legal adoptive parent at the time of application), but\nonly if the stepparent is required to provide their information on the FAFSA form in accordance with the instructions\non the FAFSA form.\nGrandparents and other family members are not eligible to take out Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent\nundergraduate student unless they have legally adopted the student.\nIn addition to the parent(s) whose resources are reported on a student9s FAFSA form, any otherwise eligible biological or\nlegal adoptive parent of the dependent undergraduate student can also take out a Direct PLUS Loan on the student9s\nbehalf, even if that parent9s information is not reported on the FAFSA form.\nNote also that more than one parent can take out a Direct PLUS Loan on behalf of the same dependent undergraduate', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default. Your school can also offer financial literacy classes, on a credit or non-credit basis, that include\ninformation on budgeting, debt management, anticipated earnings by profession, elements of loan counseling, etc.,\nthough eligibility for a Direct Loan cannot be contingent on completion of such a class.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrowers\nBelow we provide a summary of the information that must be covered in entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan\nand Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers.

There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.']","['information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07. Direct Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form If you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information sections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the student, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up to the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent second-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume for information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of the other Title IV programs. Self-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or have refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated statement from one of the student9s parents.

A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a student. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent who had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements outlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3.

For more information, see the discussion under <Direct PLUS Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.']","Direct Subsidized Loans are a type of federal student loan available to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. The key features of Direct Subsidized Loans include:

1. **Eligibility Based on Financial Need**: Only students who have been determined to have financial need are eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans.

2. **Interest Subsidy**: The federal government pays the interest on these loans while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time, during the grace period, and during deferment periods. This means that borrowers do not accrue interest during these times, making it a more affordable option compared to other loans.

3. **Loan Amounts**: If a student is determined to need a Direct Subsidized Loan for an amount of $200 or less, the school may opt not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.

4. **Loan Limits**: Direct Subsidized Loans have specific annual and aggregate limits based on the student's grade level and dependency status.

5. **Counseling Requirements**: Borrowers must complete entrance counseling before receiving their first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, which provides them with important information about their loan obligations and repayment responsibilities.

In summary, Direct Subsidized Loans are designed to help eligible undergraduate students finance their education without the burden of accruing interest while they are in school or during certain periods of deferment.","The context does not provide specific information about Direct Subsidized Loans, but it mentions that dependent undergraduate students whose parents refuse to complete the FAFSA form or have ended financial support may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans.",0.5,0.95,0.0,0.9446628364139142,0.6666666644444444,0.4,multi_query_rag

For each Direct Loan that a school disburses to a\nstudent or parent, the school must submit a loan award record to the COD System that includes the student9s grade level,\nthe loan period and academic year dates, the loan amount, the anticipated and actual dates and amounts of the loan\ndisbursements, and other information. Submission of a loan award record serves as the school9s certification that it has\ndetermined the borrower9s eligibility for the loan.\nThe specific Direct Loan amount that a student or parent borrower is eligible to receive is determined based on various\nfactors such as the student9s COA, Student Aid Index (SAI), OFA, and remaining eligibility under the annual and aggregate\nloan limits (see Chapter 4 for guidance on annual and aggregate loan limits). Some of these factors are relevant only\nwhen determining eligibility for certain types of Direct Loans. When originating a Direct Loan, the COA used in\ndetermining the loan amount may include only those costs associated with the period of enrollment (loan period) for\nwhich the loan is being originated.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans have annual and aggregate limits that are the same for all\nstudents at a given grade level and dependency status. You may not originate a Direct Loan for an amount that:\nExceeds the amount requested by the borrower;\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus the student9s SAI and OFA;\nIn the case of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan or Direct PLUS Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus OFA; or\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, would cause the student to exceed the annual or\naggregate limit.\nSee Volume 3, Chapter 3 for more information on packaging Direct Loans as part of a student9s financial aid award.\nOriginating a Loan\nIt9s important to remember that your school, not the Department, is responsible for determining a borrower9s eligibility for\na Direct Loan. Schools that originate and disburse loans to ineligible borrowers, or for loan amounts that exceed loan\nlimits or financial need, are subject to administrative actions such as a fine, limitation, suspension, and termination, as\nwell as liabilities including repayment to the government of interest and costs it has paid on the ineligible loans.\nYou must originate a Direct Loan while the student is enrolled and eligible for the period of enrollment for which the loan\nis intended. You may not originate a loan for a period in which the student is no longer enrolled. For example, you may\nnot originate a loan for a prior academic year that has ended, even if the student is enrolled and eligible for the current\nacademic year. Similarly, if a student who was enrolled at least half time only for the fall and spring quarters of an\nacademic year consisting of fall, winter, and spring quarters does not request a loan until the spring, you may not at that\ntime originate a loan for the previous fall quarter.\nFor all Direct Loans, you must document the student9s COA, SAI, and OFA in the student9s file. This information must be\nmade available to the Department upon request.\nYou must confirm that the borrower meets the definition of eligible borrower by doing the following:\nDetermine that the student is enrolled at least half time and making satisfactory academic progress (see Volume 1);\nReview the NSLDS information on the ISIR or the NSLDS Professional Access website to ensure that the student is not\nin default, does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant or loan (see Volume 1), and will not exceed the annual or\naggregate loan limits (as described in Chapter 4 of this volume);\nEnsure that the amount of the loan, in combination with other aid, will not exceed the student9s financial need or', 'A student may take the preparatory courses at School A (as long as the courses are part of an eligible program there) that\nare required for admission into a program at School B. As the awarding school, School A may require documentation from\nSchool B that these courses are required for the student9s subsequent enrollment.\nTeacher Certification Coursework\nA student may receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan (or a parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan\non behalf of a dependent student) for courses that the student must complete to receive a professional credential or\ncertificate from a state that is required for employment as an elementary or secondary school teacher in that state, even\nthough the school where the student takes the courses does not award a degree or other credential upon the completion\nof that coursework.\nVolume 8, Chapter 1, Example 1: Eligible Preparatory Coursework\nA student who previously received a bachelor9s degree with a major in mathematics now wants to enroll in a\ngraduate computer science program. The student needs 12 more semester hours of computer science coursework\nto meet the admission requirements of the school that offers the program. The student enrolls in courses that are\npart of one of the school9s undergraduate degree programs, but is not enrolled for the purpose of receiving a\ndegree and therefore is not a regular student. However, because the coursework is necessary for enrollment in\nthe graduate program, the student may receive Direct Loans for this coursework (for a maximum of one\nconsecutive 12-month period).\nVolume 8, Chapter 1, Example 2: Ineligible Preparatory Coursework\nA nursing school offers a 2-year program leading to a diploma.

Unlike scholarship programs that may award funds based on academic merit or the student9s field of study, <need-based= grants, loans, and work-study are based on the student9s demonstrated financial need for assistance. The cost of attendance (COA) is the cornerstone of establishing a student9s financial need, as it sets a limit on the total aid that a student may receive for purposes of the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, and is one of the basic components of the Pell Grant calculation. This chapter picks up at the point where the Student Aid Index (SAI) for a student has been determined. See Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide for more information on the SAI, and Volume 1 for more information on basic student eligibility requirements. Most schools establish average costs for different categories of students and set these cost categories in EDExpress or other software that they use to determine awards and package aid. The typical costs that you establish for your students will be used to calculate their Title IV award amounts and package their aid.', '<2-hop>\n\nAllowable Costs The HEA specifies the types of costs that are included in the COA, but each school must determine the appropriate and reasonable amounts to include for each eligible COA category for its students, based on the criteria described in this chapter. The COA for a student is an estimate of that student9s educational expenses for the period of enrollment. As you9ll see, in most cases you can use average expenses (for students with the same enrollment status) at your school, rather than actual expenses. For example, for the tuition and fees component, you can use the same average amount for all full-time students instead of figuring the actual tuition and fees for each individual student. You can have different standard costs for different categories of students, such as one COA for out-of-state students, who are charged higher tuition, and a different COA for in-state students, who are charged lower tuition. However, you cannot combine the COA figures for each separate enrollment status and award aid to a student based on the average COA. Students must be awarded based on a COA comprised of allowable costs assessed all students carrying the same academic workload. If a student is enrolled in a program that has extra fees or costs, such as lab fees, you can add those fees to the student9s cost or use a standard cost that you9ve established for all students in that program. If you establish standard cost categories, you must apply the cost allowances uniformly to all students in those categories. There are a variety of methods to arrive at average costs for your students, such as conducting periodic surveys of your student population, assessing local housing costs or other pertinent data, or other reasonable methods you may devise which generate accurate average costs for various categories of students. The types of costs that may be included are the same for all Title IV programs. For the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, the COA, based on the student9s enrollment status, is a student9s cost for the period for which the aid is intended. For Pell Grants, the COA is always the full-year costs for a full-time student, so you may have to prorate actual or average costs up for students who are attending less than an academic year (or who are less than full time in a term-based program) or prorate down for students who are attending for periods longer than an academic year. Note that though certain components are excluded from the Pell Grant COA for a student who is enrolled on a less-than-half-time basis, the components that are included in the less-than-half-time Pell Grant COA are still based on the full-year costs for a full-time student for a Pell Grant recipient with an enrollment intensity below 50%. See Volume 7 for guidance on Pell Grant requirements. The types of costs included in the COA are determined by section 472 of the HEA and are the only costs that may be included in a student9s COA. If a cost is not listed below, it may not be included as part of the COA. Unless it is specifically noted in the discussion of COA categories below that a particular category applies only to students who are enrolled at least half time, the types of expenses that may be included in the COA are the same for all students, regardless of enrollment status.']","The Cost of Attendance (COA) plays a crucial role in determining a student's financial aid eligibility, particularly for Direct Loans. The COA represents the total estimated cost of attending a postsecondary institution, which includes tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and other related expenses. 

When determining a student's eligibility for Direct Loans, schools must consider the COA alongside other factors such as the Student Aid Index (SAI) and any other financial aid the student is receiving (referred to as Other Financial Aid or OFA). Specifically, the amount a student can borrow through Direct Subsidized Loans is limited to the COA minus the SAI and OFA. For Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Direct PLUS Loans, the limit is the COA minus OFA.

Allowable costs factored into the COA calculation include only those expenses that are directly associated with the student's period of enrollment for which the loan is being originated. This means that schools must ensure that the COA reflects only the costs incurred during the specific loan period, avoiding duplication of non-institutional costs when a student is concurrently enrolled at multiple schools.

For example, if a student is attending two schools and receiving financial aid from both, the schools must coordinate to ensure that the total amount of loans does not exceed the applicable annual or aggregate loan limits, and that the COA does not include overlapping costs.

In summary, the COA is essential for calculating the maximum loan amount a student can receive, ensuring that financial aid is appropriately aligned with the actual costs of education.","The Cost of Attendance (COA) is crucial in determining a student's financial aid eligibility as it sets a limit on the total aid a student may receive for programs like Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs. It is a fundamental component in calculating a student's financial need, which is necessary for awarding need-based grants, loans, and work-study. The COA is an estimate of a student's educational expenses for the enrollment period and includes allowable costs as specified by the Higher Education Act (HEA). Schools must determine appropriate and reasonable amounts for each COA category based on criteria such as enrollment status and may use average expenses for students with similar enrollment statuses. Allowable costs are standardized and must be applied uniformly to all students within the same category, ensuring that aid is awarded based on a COA comprised of these allowable costs.",1.0,1.0,0.45,0.9452602070696058,0.0624999999609375,0.25,multi_query_rag

The FAFSA Simplification Act eliminated this provision. Beginning with the 2024-2025 award year, when packaging aid for any period that is not nine months, schools must use a student9s calculated 9-month SAI in the formula to determine eligibility for need-based aid, as described above (that is, COA 3 SAI 3 OFA = need). As a result of this change, students who are enrolled for periods shorter than nine months will have less financial need than would have been the case in the past when using an alternate (smaller) EFC for such periods. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more information on how this change may affect Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for students receiving loans for periods of enrollment (loan periods) shorter than nine months. Treatment of Negative SAIs A student may have a calculated SAI that is a negative number as low as -1,500. Also, as explained in Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide, certain students will automatically receive a -1,500 SAI. When packaging need-based aid for students with negative SAIs, schools must convert any negative SAIs to zero for awarding purposes. This means that a negative SAI will not increase the amount of need-based aid a student can receive. Note that a negative SAI also does not increase the amount of non-need-based aid that a student may receive because the SAI is not a factor in determining eligibility for aid that isn9t based on financial need. Packaging Rules Pell Grants as the First Source of Aid Pell Grants are the first source of aid for a student, and packaging Title IV funds begins with determining a student9s Pell Grant eligibility, as described in Volume 7. A correctly determined Pell Grant is never adjusted to take into account other forms of aid. When awarding aid from the other Title IV programs, you must ensure that the student9s need or COA is not exceeded. In some cases, a student9s aid package may include a Pell Grant and non-Title IV aid (for example, institutional aid or private education loans), but no other types of Title IV aid, and the combination of the Pell Grant and the other aid may be large enough to exceed the student9s COA. For instance, the National Collegiate Athletic Association9s (NCAA's) rules for athletic aid may permit a school to award athletic aid that covers a student9s full COA (see <NCAA Considerations= in Chapter 2 of this volume for more information). In this case, the student is still eligible for the full amount of the Pell Grant. However, you can9t award any Title IV funds other than the Pell Grant. Note that in some cases a student9s SAI may be higher than the COA, resulting in no financial need, but the student may still qualify for a calculated Pell Grant or a minimum Pell Grant (see Volume 7, Chapter 2 for more information on Pell Grant eligibility criteria). As an example, consider a student with an SAI of 6,650, a COA of $5,500, and a calculated Pell Grant amount of $745. In this circumstance the student is still eligible for the full Pell Grant amount (as long as it doesn9t exceed the COA), but you may not award any other types of need-based Title IV aid. If a student9s aid package includes a Pell Grant, other types of Title IV aid, and non-Title IV aid, and the total aid amount exceeds the student9s COA, the student still qualifies for the full Pell Grant amount, but you must adjust the other Title IV aid to ensure that the COA is not exceeded. In the circumstances described above you may (but are not required to) adjust non-Title IV aid over which you have control in accordance with your school9s policies."", '<2-hop>\n\nVerification Following Disasters The Dear Colleague Letter GEN-17-08 gives general guidance for awarding aid in federally declared disasters. It states that the Secretary will not enforce the verification requirements during the award year for applicants whose records were lost or destroyed because of a disaster if the school has tried to preserve and reconstruct any records. The school must document when it does not perform verification for this reason and use status code <S= when reporting the disbursement of Pell Grants to affected students. Also, the requirement for dependent students to submit a statement signed by a parent regarding family size is waived if the parents cannot provide the signature due to the disaster. The school must note why no parent was able to provide the statement. Schools that experience a local disaster (rather than a federally declared one) that affects Title IV administration should consult their regional school participation division. Acceptable Documentation The FAFSA Simplification Act requires that, wherever possible, the Department use data received directly from the IRS to calculate a student9s SAI and Pell Grant award. The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act (FUTURE Act) requires the Department of Education to access tax information held by the IRS pertaining to FAFSA applicants4and, where applicable, their parents and spouses4through a secure method: the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX). The FUTURE Act amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to mandate the disclosure of FTI directly from the IRS to the Department with an individual9s consent and approval. The FUTURE Act also made providing consent and approval for the exchange of FTI a requirement for receiving federal student aid. Applicants and contributors will be required to provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI directly from the IRS. When FTI is received from the IRS via the FA-DDX, the FTI received is considered verified and no additional documentation is necessary. As a result, the FA-DDX is the fastest, easiest, and most secure method of meeting income and tax verification requirements. The September 4, 2024 Federal Register Notice gives the documentation required for verifying 2025-26 application data, which depends on the item verified, as explained in this section. If you use a verification document, be sure that it is signed, that all required sections are completed, and that any relevant tax or alternative documents are attached. Copies of original documents are acceptable. An original signature on an original document, an original signature on a copy of a document, and a copy of a document with an original signature on it are all valid signatures, unless specifically noted in this chapter. If a copy of the tax return is used, the filer (or at least one of the filers of a joint return) must sign it or the tax preparer must provide their name and SSN, EIN, or PTIN. Suggested Verification Text The Department has developed suggested text that you may use to create a verification document and to verify non-tax items, such as family size. To review the suggested text for 2025-26, please see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10. The suggested text fulfills verification requirements, but schools do not have to use it, except as noted below. Instead, they may develop and use their own (or someone else9s) text, forms, documents, statements, and certifications that are specific to the items required to be verified for a particular student or group of students at the school. However, schools they tried to locate their estranged spouse. The school determines that the student doesn9t need to verify their spouse9s tax and income information. However, the student must still verify their own information. The school may also choose to use professional judgment to remove the spouse9s information from the student9s FAFSA form.']","The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the impact of the FAFSA Simplification Act on the calculation of student aid for periods shorter than nine months, nor does it detail the role of the FUTURE Act in verifying income and tax information for FAFSA applicants.

2. **Interest Benefits**: The federal government does not charge interest on Direct Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time, during the grace period after leaving school, during deferment periods, and during certain repayment periods that are based on the borrower's income and family size.

3. **Loan Limits**: There are annual and aggregate loan limits for Direct Subsidized Loans, which vary based on the student's year in school and dependency status.

4. **Concurrent Enrollment**: Students who are enrolled at multiple schools may receive Direct Subsidized Loans from each institution, but the total amount must not exceed the applicable loan limits.

5. **Exceptions**: There are limited exceptions to the requirement of being a ""regular student"" (enrolled in a degree or certificate program) for receiving Direct Loans, such as for preparatory coursework necessary for enrollment in an eligible program.

Before originating a Direct Loan, a\nschool must determine the student9s or parent9s eligibility for the loan. For each Direct Loan that a school disburses to a\nstudent or parent, the school must submit a loan award record to the COD System that includes the student9s grade level,\nthe loan period and academic year dates, the loan amount, the anticipated and actual dates and amounts of the loan\ndisbursements, and other information. Submission of a loan award record serves as the school9s certification that it has\ndetermined the borrower9s eligibility for the loan.\nThe specific Direct Loan amount that a student or parent borrower is eligible to receive is determined based on various\nfactors such as the student9s COA, Student Aid Index (SAI), OFA, and remaining eligibility under the annual and aggregate\nloan limits (see Chapter 4 for guidance on annual and aggregate loan limits).

Schools that originate and disburse loans to ineligible borrowers, or for loan amounts that exceed loan\nlimits or financial need, are subject to administrative actions such as a fine, limitation, suspension, and termination, as\nwell as liabilities including repayment to the government of interest and costs it has paid on the ineligible loans.\nYou must originate a Direct Loan while the student is enrolled and eligible for the period of enrollment for which the loan\nis intended. You may not originate a loan for a period in which the student is no longer enrolled. For example, you may\nnot originate a loan for a prior academic year that has ended, even if the student is enrolled and eligible for the current\nacademic year. Similarly, if a student who was enrolled at least half time only for the fall and spring quarters of an\nacademic year consisting of fall, winter, and spring quarters does not request a loan until the spring, you may not at that\ntime originate a loan for the previous fall quarter.\nFor all Direct Loans, you must document the student9s COA, SAI, and OFA in the student9s file.

Unlike scholarship programs that may award funds based on academic merit or the student9s field of study, <need-based= grants, loans, and work-study are based on the student9s demonstrated financial need for assistance. The cost of attendance (COA) is the cornerstone of establishing a student9s financial need, as it sets a limit on the total aid that a student may receive for purposes of the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, and is one of the basic components of the Pell Grant calculation. This chapter picks up at the point where the Student Aid Index (SAI) for a student has been determined. See Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide for more information on the SAI, and Volume 1 for more information on basic student eligibility requirements. Most schools establish average costs for different categories of students and set these cost categories in EDExpress or other software that they use to determine awards and package aid. The typical costs that you establish for your students will be used to calculate their Title IV award amounts and package their aid.', '<2-hop>\n\nAllowable Costs The HEA specifies the types of costs that are included in the COA, but each school must determine the appropriate and reasonable amounts to include for each eligible COA category for its students, based on the criteria described in this chapter. The COA for a student is an estimate of that student9s educational expenses for the period of enrollment. As you9ll see, in most cases you can use average expenses (for students with the same enrollment status) at your school, rather than actual expenses. For example, for the tuition and fees component, you can use the same average amount for all full-time students instead of figuring the actual tuition and fees for each individual student. You can have different standard costs for different categories of students, such as one COA for out-of-state students, who are charged higher tuition, and a different COA for in-state students, who are charged lower tuition. However, you cannot combine the COA figures for each separate enrollment status and award aid to a student based on the average COA. Students must be awarded based on a COA comprised of allowable costs assessed all students carrying the same academic workload. If a student is enrolled in a program that has extra fees or costs, such as lab fees, you can add those fees to the student9s cost or use a standard cost that you9ve established for all students in that program. If you establish standard cost categories, you must apply the cost allowances uniformly to all students in those categories. There are a variety of methods to arrive at average costs for your students, such as conducting periodic surveys of your student population, assessing local housing costs or other pertinent data, or other reasonable methods you may devise which generate accurate average costs for various categories of students. The types of costs that may be included are the same for all Title IV programs. For the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, the COA, based on the student9s enrollment status, is a student9s cost for the period for which the aid is intended. For Pell Grants, the COA is always the full-year costs for a full-time student, so you may have to prorate actual or average costs up for students who are attending less than an academic year (or who are less than full time in a term-based program) or prorate down for students who are attending for periods longer than an academic year. Note that though certain components are excluded from the Pell Grant COA for a student who is enrolled on a less-than-half-time basis, the components that are included in the less-than-half-time Pell Grant COA are still based on the full-year costs for a full-time student for a Pell Grant recipient with an enrollment intensity below 50%. See Volume 7 for guidance on Pell Grant requirements. The types of costs included in the COA are determined by section 472 of the HEA and are the only costs that may be included in a student9s COA. If a cost is not listed below, it may not be included as part of the COA. Unless it is specifically noted in the discussion of COA categories below that a particular category applies only to students who are enrolled at least half time, the types of expenses that may be included in the COA are the same for all students, regardless of enrollment status.']","The Cost of Attendance (COA) plays a crucial role in determining a student's financial aid eligibility, particularly for Direct Loans. The COA represents the total estimated expenses a student may incur while attending school, which includes tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and other related costs.

When calculating a student's eligibility for Direct Loans, the COA is used in conjunction with other factors such as the Student Aid Index (SAI) and any other financial aid the student may receive (referred to as Other Financial Aid or OFA). Specifically, the amount a student can borrow through Direct Subsidized Loans is limited to the COA minus the SAI and OFA. For Direct Unsubsidized Loans or Direct PLUS Loans, the limit is the COA minus OFA.

Allowable costs factored into the COA calculation must be associated with the specific period of enrollment for which the loan is being originated. This means that only costs that are relevant to the student's current academic term can be included in the COA for that loan period. Schools are responsible for ensuring that the COA does not include duplicated costs when a student is concurrently enrolled at multiple institutions.

In summary, the COA is essential for determining how much financial aid a student is eligible to receive, as it directly influences the maximum loan amounts available to them based on their financial need and other aid received.","The Cost of Attendance (COA) is crucial in determining a student's financial aid eligibility as it sets a limit on the total aid a student may receive for programs like Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs. It is a fundamental component in calculating a student's financial need, which is necessary for awarding need-based grants, loans, and work-study. The COA is an estimate of a student's educational expenses for the enrollment period and includes allowable costs as specified by the Higher Education Act (HEA). Schools must determine appropriate and reasonable amounts for each COA category based on criteria such as enrollment status and may use average expenses for students with similar enrollment statuses. Allowable costs are standardized and must be applied uniformly to all students within the same category, ensuring that aid is awarded based on a COA comprised of these allowable costs.",0.4,1.0,0.45,0.9452183323682061,0.06666666662222222,0.6,parent_document_rag
"How does the FAFSA Simplification Act impact the calculation of student aid for periods shorter than nine months, and what role does the FUTURE Act play in verifying income and tax information for FAFSA applicants?","['student. For example, if a student9s biological or legal adoptive parents are divorced, they may decide to each take out a\nDirect PLUS Loan for an agreed upon amount (not to exceed the student9s COA, minus other financial assistance (OFA)) to\nhelp pay for the cost of the student9s education.\nRequirement for Dependent Students To File a FAFSA Form\nIn all cases, the dependent student on whose behalf a parent has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan must have filed a FAFSA\nform and received an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or FAFSA Submission Summary (see Chapter 1 of the\nApplication and Verification Guide for information on the ISIR and FAFSA Submission Summary). This requirement ensures\nthat student eligibility data matches are conducted to verify that the dependent student on whose behalf the parent is\nborrowing:\nIs not in default on a Title IV loan and does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant;\nHas had their Social Security number verified by the Social Security Administration; and\nHas had their citizenship status confirmed by either the Social Security Administration or the Department of\nHomeland Security.\nNote that this requirement is for the student to submit a FAFSA form. It is not a requirement for the parent borrower to\nsubmit a FAFSA form in the parent9s name, and it does not preclude an otherwise eligible parent whose information is not\nincluded on the FAFSA form (sometimes referred to as a <non-custodial= parent) from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan.\nBefore originating a Direct PLUS Loan for a parent borrower, schools must review the ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary\nof the dependent student to ensure there are no student eligibility issues that must be resolved before the parent can\nreceive the Direct PLUS Loan.\nAdverse Credit History\nAn individual with an adverse credit history is prohibited from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan unless they meet additional\neligibility requirements. The Department obtains a credit report on each student or parent applicant for a Direct PLUS\nLoan. An applicant is considered to have an adverse credit history if:\nThey have one or more debts with a total combined outstanding balance greater than $2,085 that (1) are 90 or more\ndays delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or (2) have been placed in collection or charged-off during the two\nyears preceding the date of the credit report; or\nDuring the five years preceding the date of the credit report, the applicant has been determined to be in default on a\ndebt; has had debts discharged in bankruptcy; or has been the subject of foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage\ngarnishment, or write-off of a Title IV debt.\nFor Direct PLUS Loan eligibility purposes, <charged-off= means a debt that has been written off as a loss, but that is still\nsubject to collection action. <In collection= means a debt that has been placed with a collection agency by a creditor or\nthat is subject to more intensive efforts by a creditor to recover amounts owed from a borrower who has not responded\nsatisfactorily to the routine demands of the creditor9s billing procedures.\nAn applicant cannot be denied a Direct PLUS Loan because they have no credit history. That is, the absence of a credit\nhistory is not considered to be adverse credit.\nThere are two means by which a Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit history can still qualify for a Direct\nPLUS Loan. One option is for the applicant to obtain an endorser who doesn9t have an adverse credit history. An endorser\nis someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower doesn9t repay it. For a parent borrower, the\nendorser may not be the dependent student for whom the parent is borrowing.\nAs an alternative to obtaining an endorser, an applicant who has been determined to have an adverse credit history may\nalso qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan by submitting documentation to the Department showing that there are extenuating\ncircumstances associated with the adverse credit. The Department has the final decision on determining whether\nextenuating circumstances exist.\nA borrower who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting to the satisfaction of the\nDepartment that extenuating circumstances exist must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling, as discussed below.', 'information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form\nIf you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information\nsections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the\nstudent, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up\nto the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent\nsecond-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume\nfor information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of\nthe other Title IV programs.\nSelf-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or\nhave refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated\nstatement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students\nwithout parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide.\nDirect PLUS Loans\nDirect PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate\nstudents.\nA parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who\nmeets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a\nstudent. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is\nineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent\nwho had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements\noutlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal\ngovernment holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s\nineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student\nis otherwise eligible.\nRequirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers\nSchools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan\nProgram and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available\nto both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students. For more information, see the\ndiscussion under <Direct PLUS Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDefinition of <Parent= for Direct PLUS Loan Purposes\nIf they meet all other Direct PLUS Loan eligibility requirements, the following individuals can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on\nbehalf of a dependent undergraduate student:\nThe student9s biological parent;\nThe student9s legal adoptive parent; or\nThe student9s stepparent (spouse of the student9s biological or legal adoptive parent at the time of application), but\nonly if the stepparent is required to provide their information on the FAFSA form in accordance with the instructions\non the FAFSA form.\nGrandparents and other family members are not eligible to take out Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent\nundergraduate student unless they have legally adopted the student.\nIn addition to the parent(s) whose resources are reported on a student9s FAFSA form, any otherwise eligible biological or\nlegal adoptive parent of the dependent undergraduate student can also take out a Direct PLUS Loan on the student9s\nbehalf, even if that parent9s information is not reported on the FAFSA form.\nNote also that more than one parent can take out a Direct PLUS Loan on behalf of the same dependent undergraduate', 'Volume 8\nThe Direct Loan Program\nIntroduction\nUnder the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loan Program), the U.S. Department of Education (the\nDepartment) makes loans to help students and parents pay the cost of attendance (COA) at a postsecondary school. This\nvolume of the Federal Student Aid Handbook provides information to assist schools in determining student and parent\neligibility for Direct Loans, counseling student borrowers, and awarding Direct Loans.\nChanges for 2025-2026\nWe have made the following changes in Volume 8 for 2025-2026:\nIn Chapter 3, we have revised the discussion of loan periods to provide a limited exception to the longstanding\nrequirement that the loan period for a Direct Loan may not include any terms in which the borrower is ineligible to\nreceive Direct Loan funds.\nAlso in Chapter 3, we have added a slightly revised and expanded version of guidance on the treatment of Direct\nLoan disbursements made after the date of a borrower9s death that was previously in Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the FSA\nHandbook under the heading <Checking Eligibility at the Time of Disbursement.= Because this guidance is specific to\nDirect Loans, we believe Volume 8 is a more appropriate location.\nIn Chapter 5, we have revised Example 6 to reflect the limited exception to the requirement that a loan period may\nnot include terms in which the borrower is ineligible (see Chapter 3 changes above).\nIn Chapter 7, we have revised the discussion of transfer students and abbreviated loan periods to clarify that in some\ncircumstances a transfer student may be eligible to receive more Direct Loan funds for the program at the new\nschool than a non-transfer student would be eligible to receive for that same program.\nExcept as noted above, there are no other substantive changes to Volume 8 for 2025-2026.']","[""<1-hop>\n\nPrior to the 2024-2025 award year, the HEA allowed schools to use alternate expected family contributions (EFCs) when packaging aid for periods other than nine months. The FAFSA Simplification Act eliminated this provision. Beginning with the 2024-2025 award year, when packaging aid for any period that is not nine months, schools must use a student9s calculated 9-month SAI in the formula to determine eligibility for need-based aid, as described above (that is, COA 3 SAI 3 OFA = need). As a result of this change, students who are enrolled for periods shorter than nine months will have less financial need than would have been the case in the past when using an alternate (smaller) EFC for such periods. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more information on how this change may affect Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for students receiving loans for periods of enrollment (loan periods) shorter than nine months. Treatment of Negative SAIs A student may have a calculated SAI that is a negative number as low as -1,500. Also, as explained in Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide, certain students will automatically receive a -1,500 SAI. When packaging need-based aid for students with negative SAIs, schools must convert any negative SAIs to zero for awarding purposes. This means that a negative SAI will not increase the amount of need-based aid a student can receive. Note that a negative SAI also does not increase the amount of non-need-based aid that a student may receive because the SAI is not a factor in determining eligibility for aid that isn9t based on financial need. Packaging Rules Pell Grants as the First Source of Aid Pell Grants are the first source of aid for a student, and packaging Title IV funds begins with determining a student9s Pell Grant eligibility, as described in Volume 7. A correctly determined Pell Grant is never adjusted to take into account other forms of aid. When awarding aid from the other Title IV programs, you must ensure that the student9s need or COA is not exceeded. In some cases, a student9s aid package may include a Pell Grant and non-Title IV aid (for example, institutional aid or private education loans), but no other types of Title IV aid, and the combination of the Pell Grant and the other aid may be large enough to exceed the student9s COA. For instance, the National Collegiate Athletic Association9s (NCAA's) rules for athletic aid may permit a school to award athletic aid that covers a student9s full COA (see <NCAA Considerations= in Chapter 2 of this volume for more information). In this case, the student is still eligible for the full amount of the Pell Grant. However, you can9t award any Title IV funds other than the Pell Grant. Note that in some cases a student9s SAI may be higher than the COA, resulting in no financial need, but the student may still qualify for a calculated Pell Grant or a minimum Pell Grant (see Volume 7, Chapter 2 for more information on Pell Grant eligibility criteria). As an example, consider a student with an SAI of 6,650, a COA of $5,500, and a calculated Pell Grant amount of $745. In this circumstance the student is still eligible for the full Pell Grant amount (as long as it doesn9t exceed the COA), but you may not award any other types of need-based Title IV aid. If a student9s aid package includes a Pell Grant, other types of Title IV aid, and non-Title IV aid, and the total aid amount exceeds the student9s COA, the student still qualifies for the full Pell Grant amount, but you must adjust the other Title IV aid to ensure that the COA is not exceeded. In the circumstances described above you may (but are not required to) adjust non-Title IV aid over which you have control in accordance with your school9s policies."", '<2-hop>\n\nVerification Following Disasters The Dear Colleague Letter GEN-17-08 gives general guidance for awarding aid in federally declared disasters. It states that the Secretary will not enforce the verification requirements during the award year for applicants whose records were lost or destroyed because of a disaster if the school has tried to preserve and reconstruct any records. The school must document when it does not perform verification for this reason and use status code <S= when reporting the disbursement of Pell Grants to affected students. Also, the requirement for dependent students to submit a statement signed by a parent regarding family size is waived if the parents cannot provide the signature due to the disaster. The school must note why no parent was able to provide the statement. Schools that experience a local disaster (rather than a federally declared one) that affects Title IV administration should consult their regional school participation division. Acceptable Documentation The FAFSA Simplification Act requires that, wherever possible, the Department use data received directly from the IRS to calculate a student9s SAI and Pell Grant award. The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act (FUTURE Act) requires the Department of Education to access tax information held by the IRS pertaining to FAFSA applicants4and, where applicable, their parents and spouses4through a secure method: the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX). The FUTURE Act amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to mandate the disclosure of FTI directly from the IRS to the Department with an individual9s consent and approval. The FUTURE Act also made providing consent and approval for the exchange of FTI a requirement for receiving federal student aid. Applicants and contributors will be required to provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI directly from the IRS. When FTI is received from the IRS via the FA-DDX, the FTI received is considered verified and no additional documentation is necessary. As a result, the FA-DDX is the fastest, easiest, and most secure method of meeting income and tax verification requirements. The September 4, 2024 Federal Register Notice gives the documentation required for verifying 2025-26 application data, which depends on the item verified, as explained in this section. If you use a verification document, be sure that it is signed, that all required sections are completed, and that any relevant tax or alternative documents are attached. Copies of original documents are acceptable. An original signature on an original document, an original signature on a copy of a document, and a copy of a document with an original signature on it are all valid signatures, unless specifically noted in this chapter. If a copy of the tax return is used, the filer (or at least one of the filers of a joint return) must sign it or the tax preparer must provide their name and SSN, EIN, or PTIN. Suggested Verification Text The Department has developed suggested text that you may use to create a verification document and to verify non-tax items, such as family size. To review the suggested text for 2025-26, please see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10. The suggested text fulfills verification requirements, but schools do not have to use it, except as noted below. Instead, they may develop and use their own (or someone else9s) text, forms, documents, statements, and certifications that are specific to the items required to be verified for a particular student or group of students at the school. However, schools they tried to locate their estranged spouse. The school determines that the student doesn9t need to verify their spouse9s tax and income information. However, the student must still verify their own information. The school may also choose to use professional judgment to remove the spouse9s information from the student9s FAFSA form.']","The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the impact of the FAFSA Simplification Act on the calculation of student aid for periods shorter than nine months. Therefore, I cannot provide details on that aspect.

Regarding the FUTURE Act, the context does not mention it or its role in verifying income and tax information for FAFSA applicants. As a result, I cannot provide information on how the FUTURE Act interacts with the FAFSA process.
