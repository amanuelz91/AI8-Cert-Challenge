Direct Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form If you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information sections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the student, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up to the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent second-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume for information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of the other Title IV programs. Self-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or have refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated statement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students without parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide. Direct PLUS Loans Direct PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate students. A parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who meets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a student. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent who had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements outlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal government holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s ineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student is otherwise eligible. Requirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers Schools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan Program and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available to both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit Direct PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students.

However, the school must not make any subsequent disbursements of the loan unless the student resumes enrollment on at least a half-time basis during the payment period. A student who is no longer enrolled at least half time may not receive as a late disbursement any second or subsequent disbursement of the loan. Note that different requirements apply if a student who received a Direct Loan disbursement prior to the first day of classes fails to begin attendance in any classes. See <When A Student Fails to Begin Attendance= in Volume 4, Chapter 3. If a student does not withdraw but ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a school may make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred by the student for a period in which the student was eligible. However, this does not apply if the student dropped all future classes or modules, because the student never began classes as a half-time student. Title IV program funds (including Direct Loans) are disbursed to a student on the presumption that the student will attend the hours for which aid has been awarded. Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of a Direct Loan until a student has begun attendance in enough hours to establish half-time enrollment status. However, if a school has not yet made a Direct Loan disbursement to a student who has dropped classes, and the school determines that the student never began attendance in enough classes to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan to that student. Likewise, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules drops all future classes before beginning attendance in enough modules to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan because the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis. If a student who dropped to less-than-half-time status resumes enrollment on a half-time basis during the payment period or period of enrollment, the school may make remaining disbursements of a Direct Loan if the school documents (1) the student9s revised COA, and (2) that the student continues to qualify for the entire amount of the loan, despite any reduction in the student9s COA caused by the temporary cessation of enrollment on at least a half-time basis.

If a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death, the school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent student (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4 of this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.', '<2-hop>\n\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and nonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","Exceptions to the normal loan period apply to Direct PLUS Loans when clinical work is involved by allowing the loan period start date to be the beginning date of the clinical work if it starts before the term, and the loan period end date to be the ending date of the clinical work if it ends after the term. This adjustment ensures that the loan period accurately reflects the duration of the clinical work. In the event that a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passes away, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended.

"What are the requirements for entrance counseling for first-time Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers, and how does this relate to the overall Direct Loan counseling process?","['<1-hop>\n\nChapter 2 Direct Loan Counseling Counseling Overview First-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a Direct Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers who meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit history. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school responsibilities.', '<2-hop>\n\nEntrance Counseling Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. For this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student who requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before the authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan to a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling. Entrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are about to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person counseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. If entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable steps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the terms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the borrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic document. Your school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance education, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed. You may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance counseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements are reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that unreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling can include one or more of the following: Extra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods; A requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though you cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan); A requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or A requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.']","Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers. This counseling provides comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan and the borrower's responsibility to repay it. It can be conducted in-person, through written forms, or online, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. Schools must ensure that students complete the counseling, which may include a test of their understanding. This requirement is part of the broader Direct Loan counseling process, which also includes exit counseling for all student Direct Loan borrowers before they cease to be enrolled at least half-time. The overall process ensures that borrowers are informed about their loans and responsibilities, aligning with the school's responsibilities to guide students through their financial aid options.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
How do student loan eligibility criteria and minimum loan periods interact when a student is ineligible for a term within a fall-winter-spring academic year?,"['<1-hop>\n\nperiod are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and spring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be enrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering the fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s COA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a school initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of at least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily drops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not required to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school to adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and spring quarters only. In the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring- only loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring loan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would then be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining the student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods Other Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a student9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs associated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the fall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months. The limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last terms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period. For instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall term or the spring term. Note: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when periods of clinical work are included in a standard term.', '<2-hop>\n\nMinimum Loan Periods The minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar. As explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on whether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard or nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the case of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below. Nonstandard terms may be one of the following types: 1. Nonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any other term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length. SE9W Period of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition 34 CFR 685.102(b)']","Student loan eligibility criteria allow a school to originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring period even if a student is ineligible for one of the terms, such as the winter quarter, provided the student is eligible during the first and last terms of the loan period. However, no costs associated with the ineligible term can be included in the student's Cost of Attendance (COA) when determining the loan amount. The minimum loan period for originating a Direct Loan depends on the school's academic calendar and whether the program is term-based or non-term. For term-based programs with nonstandard terms, the terms must be substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length. This interaction ensures that while students can receive loans for eligible terms, the loan amounts must be adjusted to reflect only the periods of eligibility, adhering to the minimum loan period requirements.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How does proration apply to students in clock-hour programs when their remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year, and what are some examples of this proration process?","['<1-hop>\n\nGraduate Early From a Clock-Hour Program= later in this chapter). In a standard-term program, or a credit-hour program using SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of study is considered shorter than an academic year if the remaining period contains fewer terms than the number of terms covered by the school9s Title IV academic year. For programs that are offered in a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY; see Chapter 6), the number of terms covered in the school9s Title IV academic year usually does not include a summer <header= or <trailer= term. Consider a student who is enrolled in a four-year program that is offered in an SAY consisting of three quarters plus a summer trailer, and who has completed four academic years of study. The student needs to attend an additional quarter term to complete the program requirements. The final quarter term falls in a new academic year; therefore the annual loan limit must be prorated because the remaining period of study (a single quarter) is less than a full academic year. Similarly, if a student enrolled in a two-year program not offered in an SAY (where the Title IV academic year covers two 15-week semesters) has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to complete the program requirements, the loan limit must be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester. Note that for standard-term programs or credit-hour programs with SE9W nonstandard terms, the length of the loan period does not determine whether a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year. The determining factor is the length of the remaining period of study in which the student is enrolled, which may not be the same as the loan period. For example, if an undergraduate student is enrolled for a full SAY consisting of fall and spring semesters, and will complete the program at the end of the spring term, but is enrolled less than half time during the spring, the student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan only for the fall semester. Although the loan period (fall only) is shorter than an academic year, the remaining period of study (fall through spring) is a full academic year. Therefore, if the student receives a Direct Loan in the fall, proration of the annual loan limit is not required. In a clock-hour program, non-term program, or a program with non-SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of study is considered less than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program9s defined Title IV academic year. In contrast to standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, if a student enrolled in a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is in a remaining period of study shorter than an academic year and receives a Direct Loan, the loan period and the remaining period of study will always be the same. This is because for these programs the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program (or remaining portion of a program) or the academic year. For all types of programs, you determine the prorated loan limit for a student enrolled in a remaining period of study less than an academic year by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by the following fraction: Unlike proration for programs that are shorter than an academic year, there is no comparison of weeks and hours. Only the credit or clock hours that the student is scheduled to attend, or is actually attending, at the time of origination are used in the calculation.', '<2-hop>\n\nProration Examples: Remaining Periods of Study Shorter Than an Academic Year Examples 3 through 7 illustrate how the prorated annual loan limit is determined when a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study shorter than an academic year. Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours enrolled in program Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours in academic year Volume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3: Remaining Period = One Quarter']","In clock-hour programs, if a student's remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year, the loan limit must be prorated. This is because the remaining period consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program's defined Title IV academic year. Unlike standard-term programs, the loan period and the remaining period of study in clock-hour programs will always be the same, as the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program or the academic year. Proration is determined by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by a fraction based on the credit or clock hours the student is scheduled to attend. Examples of this proration process include scenarios where a student is enrolled in a remaining period of one quarter, as illustrated in Volume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

Students who complete online exit counseling on the Department9s StudentAid.gov website fulfill this requirement as part of the counseling session; NSLDS provides the information to the loan holders. Counseling Methods The Department offers Direct Loan Program online entrance and exit counseling for students on the StudentAid.gov website. Your school will receive notification through the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) (see <Required Electronic Processes= in Volume 2, Chapter 3 for more information) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers, and completion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If your school documents that borrowers have completed the Department9s online counseling, it has satisfied its counseling responsibility. Documentation that a borrower has completed the Department9s online entrance or exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan entrance or exit counseling requirements. Your school may also choose to provide entrance or exit counseling through an in-person session or (for entrance counseling) by providing a separate written form to the student that the student signs and returns to the school. If your school conducts in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions can help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive programs to ensure that students understand the terms and conditions of their loans. Counseling materials, such as the entrance and exit counseling guides, are available in the Financial Aid Toolkit. A school may adopt an alternative approach for entrance counseling as a part of its quality assurance plan. For more information, see the regulation cited below."", ""<2-hop>\n\nIf you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower has received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of their financial need, and the student is still enrolled for the loan period, you must return the subsidized loan amount for which the student was ineligible and ask the student if they wish to replace the subsidized funds with a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. If the student agrees to accept the unsubsidized loan funds and they also received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the same loan period as the Direct Subsidized Loan, you may increase the amount of the Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursements by the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. If the student did not receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you may originate a new Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. The new Direct Unsubsidized Loan must have the same loan period and disbursement dates as the Direct Subsidized Loan. If the student does not agree to have the excess subsidized loan funds replaced by a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must still return the ineligible Direct Subsidized Loan amount. If you discover that a student received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of financial need after the student is no longer enrolled for the loan period, you are not required to take any action to eliminate the excess subsidized loan amount. If you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower who was eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan instead received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must correct the error (even if the loan period has ended) by submitting a downward adjustment to reduce or eliminate the Direct Unsubsidized Loan, as appropriate, and replacing it with the same amount of Direct Subsidized Loan funds. You may do this either by adjusting an existing Direct Subsidized Loan upwards, or, if the student does not have an existing Direct Subsidized Loan, by originating a new Direct Subsidized Loan. Replacing a Direct Unsubsidized Loan with a Direct Subsidized Loan in this circumstance does not require obtaining the student9s consent. Direct Loan Overawards As explained in Volume 4, Chapter 3, an overaward exists when a student9s aid package exceeds their need or overall COA. If you discover that a student who received Direct Loans has been overawarded and your school has already received and disbursed some or all of the Direct Loan funds, you have the following options: If the student9s aid package includes a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, or a nonfederal education loan, and the aid package doesn9t already apply these loans toward the student9s SAI, you may choose to adjust the aid package to have all or a portion of these loans replace the SAI, thus reducing or eliminating the overaward (for more detail and examples, see <Substituting for the SAI= in Volume 3, Chapter 3). If you have not yet made the second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan, you can reduce or cancel the second or subsequent disbursement. If the overaward situation occurs after the full amount of a Direct Loan has been disbursed, you do not need to adjust the amount of the loan. However, you might have to adjust the aid package to prevent an overaward of Campus-Based funds or to prevent the total aid package from exceeding the student9s need. Although a school isn9t required to return Direct Loan funds that were disbursed to the borrower (either directly or by applying them to the student's account) before the overaward situation occurred, the law doesn9t prevent your school from returning funds that were applied to the student account if you choose to do so. A borrower who receives a direct payment of loan funds is not required to repay an overawarded amount, unless the overaward was caused by the borrower9s misreporting or withholding of information.""]","The Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) facilitates compliance with Direct Loan exit counseling requirements by notifying schools of online loan counseling completed by borrowers. This ensures that schools are aware of students fulfilling their counseling responsibilities, as completion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If a student receives excess Direct Subsidized Loan funds, the school must return the ineligible amount if the student is still enrolled. The student can choose to replace the excess subsidized funds with a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. If the student agrees, the school may increase the Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursements or originate a new one for the same loan period. If the student does not agree, the excess subsidized loan amount must still be returned.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does the FSA Handbook guide schools in handling loan adjustments for clinical work and the death of a Title IV aid recipient?,"['<1-hop>\n\nmay not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of payments while the student was enrolled at least half time. If a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death, the school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent student (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4 of this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.', '<2-hop>\n\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and nonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","The FSA Handbook provides guidance for schools on handling loan adjustments in two specific scenarios. Firstly, when a Title IV aid recipient dies, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original loan that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended. This is detailed in Appendix B of the FSA Handbook. Secondly, for clinical work included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the FSA Handbook allows for exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules. If clinical work begins before or ends after the normal term dates, the loan period start and end dates must be adjusted accordingly. This ensures that the academic year period and payment period dates align with the clinical work schedule, as explained in Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"What happens to a student's Direct Unsubsidized Loan eligibility if their parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan, and how does entrance counseling play a role in this process?","['<1-hop>\n\nEffect of a Change in Student Status on Aggregate Loan Limits In some cases, a student may qualify for higher loan limits but then lose eligibility for the higher limits due to a change in status. One such situation is when a dependent undergraduate qualifies for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, but in a subsequent academic year the student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan. In this circumstance the dependent student no longer qualifies for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. During any academic year when a dependent student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student is subject to the dependent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student otherwise would have been eligible to receive under the dependent undergraduate annual loan limits are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the $31,000 combined subsidized and unsubsidized dependent undergraduate aggregate limit (see Example 3 below). A similar situation occurs when a student who received loans for a graduate or professional degree program later returns to school and enrolls in an undergraduate program. The student is then subject to the undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student previously received as an undergraduate are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the undergraduate aggregate loan limit (see Example 2 earlier in this chapter). Volume 8, Chapter 4, Example 3: Aggregate Loan Limits and Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Amounts When Parents Are Unable To Obtain Direct PLUS Loans A dependent student receives additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the additional amounts available to independent undergraduates) for the first three years of a four-year program because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan for each of those years. For each of the first three years, the student receives the maximum subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts under the independent student annual loan limits (remember that the annual subsidized maximums are the same for dependent and independent undergraduates): First Year (independent student loan limit) $3,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Second Year (independent student loan limit) $4,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Third Year (independent student loan limit) $5,500 subsidized $7,000 unsubsidized ($5,000 more than dependent maximum) Total $13,500 subsidized $19,000 unsubsidized ($13,000 more than dependent maximum) In the fourth year, the parent is eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, so the student is then subject to the annual and aggregate loan limits for a dependent undergraduate. The dependent student received a total of $13,500 in Direct Subsidized Loan funds and $19,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds ($32,500 combined subsidized and unsubsidized total) for the first three years when the student9s parent was unable to obtain Direct PLUS Loans. These are the same amounts that an independent student who qualified for the maximum annual loan limit each year could have received. If the student9s parent had been able to receive Direct PLUS Loans during each of the first three years and the student received the maximum subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts under the', '<2-hop>\n\nEntrance Counseling Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. For this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student who requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before the authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan to a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling. Entrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are about to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person counseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. If entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable steps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the terms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the borrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic document. Your school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance education, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed. You may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance counseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements are reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that unreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling can include one or more of the following: Extra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods; A requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though you cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan); A requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or A requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.']","If a dependent student's parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student no longer qualifies for the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. Instead, the student is subject to the dependent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers, ensuring they understand the terms and conditions of the loan and their responsibility to repay it. This counseling must be completed before the first disbursement of the loan, providing comprehensive information to the borrower.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
