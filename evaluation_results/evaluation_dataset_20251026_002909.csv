Direct Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form If you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information sections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the student, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up to the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent second-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume for information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of the other Title IV programs. Self-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or have refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated statement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students without parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide. Direct PLUS Loans Direct PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate students. A parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who meets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a student. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent who had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements outlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal government holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s ineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student is otherwise eligible. Requirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers Schools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan Program and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available to both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit Direct PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students.

Wht is DCL GEN-16-10?,"['Direct Loan Eligibility After an Enrollment Status Change If a student who received a disbursement of Direct Loan funds prior to the first day of classes of a payment period begins attendance on a less-than-half-time basis, there is no requirement for the school or the student to return the loan funds as long as: The student began attendance in at least one course during the payment period; and At the time of the loan disbursement the student was enrolled (registered) for classes on at least a half-time basis. However, the school must not make any subsequent disbursements of the loan unless the student resumes enrollment on at least a half-time basis during the payment period. A student who is no longer enrolled at least half time may not receive as a late disbursement any second or subsequent disbursement of the loan. Note that different requirements apply if a student who received a Direct Loan disbursement prior to the first day of classes fails to begin attendance in any classes. See <When A Student Fails to Begin Attendance= in Volume 4, Chapter 3. If a student does not withdraw but ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a school may make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred by the student for a period in which the student was eligible. However, this does not apply if the student dropped all future classes or modules, because the student never began classes as a half-time student. Title IV program funds (including Direct Loans) are disbursed to a student on the presumption that the student will attend the hours for which aid has been awarded. Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of a Direct Loan until a student has begun attendance in enough hours to establish half-time enrollment status. However, if a school has not yet made a Direct Loan disbursement to a student who has dropped classes, and the school determines that the student never began attendance in enough classes to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan to that student. Likewise, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules drops all future classes before beginning attendance in enough modules to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan because the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis. If a student who dropped to less-than-half-time status resumes enrollment on a half-time basis during the payment period or period of enrollment, the school may make remaining disbursements of a Direct Loan if the school documents (1) the student9s revised COA, and (2) that the student continues to qualify for the entire amount of the loan, despite any reduction in the student9s COA caused by the temporary cessation of enrollment on at least a half-time basis.

For a Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loan, you must also: Determine the student9s Pell Grant eligibility and, if they are eligible, include the grant in the student9s aid package; For a Direct Unsubsidized Loan made to an undergraduate student, first determine the student9s eligibility for a Direct Subsidized Loan and, if the student is eligible, include the Direct Subsidized Loan in the student9s aid package; Ensure that the amount of the loan will not exceed the student9s annual or aggregate loan limits; and Prorate the annual loan limit for an undergraduate enrolled in a program or remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year (as described in Chapter 5 of this volume).', '<2-hop>\n\nNo Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods Other Than Nine Months If you originate a Direct Loan for a period shorter than a full academic year (for example, a loan for a single term or for a program shorter than an academic year), the loan amount must be based on the reduced costs for that shorter period of enrollment rather than the costs for the full academic year. However, as explained in Volume 3, Chapter 3, there are no alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months comparable to the alternate EFCs for periods other than nine months that were used prior to the 2024-2025 award year. In all cases you must use the student9s full calculated 9- month SAI in the formula to determine financial need for Direct Subsidized Loans and other need-based aid even though the COA will reflect the reduced costs for the shorter loan period. This means that students enrolled for periods shorter than nine months will have less financial need than would have been the case in the past when using a smaller alternate EFC, because now the full calculated SAI must be subtracted from the reduced COA for the shorter period of enrollment when determining financial need for purposes of Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility. Volume 8, Chapter 3, Example 1: Effect of No Alternate SAI on Financial Need When Originating Loans for Periods Less Than Nine Months A first-year dependent student has a COA of $10,800 for an academic year consisting of the fall and spring semesters and an SAI of 8,000, so the student9s financial need for the fall-spring enrollment period is $2,800 (see Volume 3, Chapter 3 for guidance on determining financial need). The student is not eligible for a Pell Grant and receives no Title IV aid except for Direct Loans. The student qualifies for a $2,800 Direct Subsidized Loan to fully cover their financial need. (The student could also receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, but for purposes of this example we cover only Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility.) The student will also be enrolled for the summer term, which the school treats as a <trailer= to the preceding fall- spring Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) for purposes of monitoring annual loan limits (see Chapter 6 of this Volume). The summer term is four months in length and the COA for that term is $4,000. For students who attend the summer term and request Direct Loan funds, the school9s normal practice is to originate a separate loan for the summer term only. Because there is no alternate SAI for periods of enrollment less than nine months and the student9s SAI of 8,000 is greater than the summer term COA, the student has no financial need for summer and is therefore ineligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan for that term (but could receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan). As an alternative to originating a separate summer-only loan, the school could choose to originate a single loan for a loan period covering the fall-spring SAY plus the summer trailer term. The student9s COA for that period of enrollment is $14,800. Subtracting the student9s SAI of 8,000 from the COA results in financial need of $6,800. The student would therefore be eligible to receive a $3,500 Direct Subsidized Loan (the maximum subsidized annual loan limit for a dependent first-year student) for the fall-spring-summer loan period.']","The absence of alternate SAIs for periods shorter than nine months means that the full calculated 9-month SAI must be used to determine financial need, even though the COA is reduced for the shorter period. This results in less financial need being calculated for students enrolled for shorter periods, as the full SAI is subtracted from the reduced COA. For Direct PLUS Loans, it is essential to ensure that the student has completed a FAFSA form and that the loan disbursement dates meet cash management and disbursement requirements. The implications for Direct PLUS Loans are that the financial need calculation may affect the overall aid package, but the primary focus remains on ensuring compliance with federal regulations and proper loan origination processes.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
How do student loan eligibility and minimum loan periods interact when a student is ineligible for a term within a fall-winter-spring academic year?,"['<1-hop>\n\nperiod are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and spring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be enrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering the fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s COA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a school initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of at least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily drops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not required to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school to adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and spring quarters only. In the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring- only loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring loan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would then be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining the student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods Other Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a student9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs associated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the fall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months. The limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last terms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period. For instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall term or the spring term. Note: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when periods of clinical work are included in a standard term.', '<2-hop>\n\nMinimum Loan Periods The minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar. As explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on whether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard or nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the case of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below. Nonstandard terms may be one of the following types: 1.

"What happens to the loan limits for a student who transfers from a graduate program to an undergraduate program during the same academic year, especially for dependent undergraduates?","['<1-hop>\n\nNote that for dependent undergraduates, the annual loan limits shown above in Tables 2A and 2B do not provide an additional unsubsidized loan amount beyond the maximum annual subsidized amount, as is the case with the loan limits for independent undergraduates and dependent undergraduates whose parents cannot get Direct PLUS Loans. For dependent undergraduates enrolled in preparatory coursework or teacher certification programs, there is just a single annual loan limit representing the maximum amount of subsidized and/or unsubsidized loans that the student may receive for an academic year. For example, a dependent undergraduate taking preparatory coursework required for enrollment in a graduate or professional program could receive up to $5,500 per academic year in Direct Loan funds, which could be all subsidized, all unsubsidized, or a combination of subsidized and unsubsidized. In contrast, an independent undergraduate taking the same preparatory coursework could receive up to $12,500 per academic year, not more than $5,500 of which could be subsidized. Loan limits for preparatory coursework and teacher certification coursework are not subject to proration (see Chapter 5 of this volume) if the coursework is less than a full academic year. Combined Undergraduate and Graduate Programs Some programs combine undergraduate and graduate study and allow a student to complete both a bachelor\'s degree and a graduate or professional degree within the same program. These are referred to as ""dual degree programs."" For instance, a school could offer a 5-year dual degree program leading to both a bachelor\'s degree and a graduate or professional degree and could define the first three or four years of study as being at the undergraduate level, and the remaining year(s) of study as being at the graduate or professional level. A student may receive Direct Loans at the applicable undergraduate annual loan limits (as well as other Title IV aid at the undergraduate level) during the undergraduate portion of such a program, and then may receive Direct Loans at the graduate and professional student annual loan limit (and also Direct PLUS Loans) for the graduate and professional portion of the program. See Volume 1 for more detailed guidance on student eligibility for Title IV aid in programs that combine undergraduate and graduate study, including programs that lead only to a graduate or professional degree, but admit students who do not yet meet the regulatory requirements to be considered graduate or professional degree students. Students Returning for a Second Baccalaureate Degree If a student with a baccalaureate degree enrolls in another baccalaureate program, the student9s grade level for loan limit purposes would be based on the amount of work that the school counts toward satisfying the requirements of the new program. For instance, if your school accepts 30 semester hours of a student9s work in a previous baccalaureate program toward the requirements for a BS in Chemistry at your school and, on that basis, classifies the student at the second-year level, then the student would be eligible for second-year undergraduate loan limits (see <Loan Limit When a Baccalaureate or Associate Degree Is Required for Admission to an Undergraduate Program= earlier in this chapter for the loan limit that applies when a student is required to have a prior associate or baccalaureate degree as a condition for being admitted to an undergraduate program).', '<2-hop>\n\nStudents Who Transfer From a Graduate Program to an Undergraduate Program During an Academic Year If a student transfers from a graduate program to an undergraduate program in the middle of an academic year, the undergraduate annual loan limit for the student9s grade level applies but amounts previously borrowed at the graduate level within the same academic year do not count against the undergraduate annual loan limit. However, the total amount awarded for the academic year may not exceed the higher (graduate or professional) annual loan limit. Volume 8, Chapter 4, Example 1: Transfer From a Graduate to Undergraduate Program During the Same Academic Year A student who received $10,250 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds for a fall semester loan as a graduate student enrolls in an undergraduate program at the same school in the spring semester of the school9s fall-spring academic year and is classified as a third-year independent undergraduate.

Non- SE9W We refer to the first type of nonstandard term as <SE9W= nonstandard terms. We group the second and third types together and refer to them as <non-SE9W= nonstandard terms. Programs with SE9W nonstandard terms are treated the same as standard-term programs for purposes of determining minimum loan period length and monitoring annual loan limits. However, programs with non-SE9W nonstandard terms are treated the same as non-term programs for these purposes. Note that substantially equal nonstandard terms (the first two types of nonstandard terms described above) are treated differently for purposes of determining Direct Loan payment periods than for determining minimum loan period length and monitoring annual loan limits. As explained in Volume 1, Chapter 1, if a program is offered in standard terms or in nonstandard terms that are substantially equal in length (regardless of the length of the nonstandard term), the payment period is the term. However, for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limits, substantially equal nonstandard terms that contain fewer than nine weeks are treated the same as nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal. This means that if a program has substantially equal nonstandard terms that are less than nine weeks in length, you must make a Direct Loan disbursement each term (the same as would be the case if the program were offered in standard terms), but the minimum loan period and the type of academic year used to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits must be determined in accordance with the rules that apply to non-term programs. For detailed information on standard term, nonstandard term, and non-term programs, see Volume 1, Chapter 1. Minimum Loan Period: Standard Term and SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs For credit-hour programs with standard terms (semesters, quarters, or trimesters), or with SE9W nonstandard terms, the minimum loan period is a single academic term. For example, if a student will be enrolled in the fall semester only and will skip the spring semester, you may originate a loan with a loan period that covers only the fall term. Minimum Loan Period: Clock-Hour, Non-Term, and Non-SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs For all other programs (i.e., clock-hour, non-term, and non-SE9W nonstandard term programs), the minimum loan period is generally the lesser of the program length (or remainder of the program, if there is less than full academic year remaining) or the academic year. There are exceptions to this minimum loan period rule when originating loans for transfer students, or for students who complete or otherwise cease enrollment in one program and then begin a different program at the same school.

"What are the procedures for handling Direct PLUS Loan funds if a parent borrower dies, and how does entrance counseling play a role in this process?","['<1-hop>\n\nEntrance Counseling Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. For this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student who requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before the authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan to a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling. Entrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are about to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person counseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. If entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable steps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the terms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the borrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic document. Your school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance education, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed. You may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance counseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements are reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that unreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling can include one or more of the following: Extra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods; A requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though you cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan); A requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or A requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', '<2-hop>\n\nmay not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of payments while the student was enrolled at least half time.

This section of the law requires the Department to make available to postsecondary schools and other entities a wide variety of information about federal student assistance programs, including information to help students assess the debt burden and repayment obligations that will be incurred as a result of receiving Title IV loans. As noted below under < Counseling Methods,= documentation that a borrower has completed the Department9s online exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan exit counseling requirements. Schools that choose to conduct their own exit counseling can meet the requirement to provide borrowers with the information made available by the Department in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA by providing borrowers with a copy of the Department9s Direct Loan Exit Counseling Guide. Providing Borrower Information at Separation Schools that conduct their own exit counseling must provide the current personal information collected from the student (name, address, references, etc.) to students9 loan servicers within 60 days. Students authorize their school to release information to servicers in the loan promissory note they signed. No further permission is needed. Students who complete online exit counseling on the Department9s StudentAid.gov website fulfill this requirement as part of the counseling session; NSLDS provides the information to the loan holders. Counseling Methods The Department offers Direct Loan Program online entrance and exit counseling for students on the StudentAid.gov website. Your school will receive notification through the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) (see <Required Electronic Processes= in Volume 2, Chapter 3 for more information) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers, and completion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If your school documents that borrowers have completed the Department9s online counseling, it has satisfied its counseling responsibility. Documentation that a borrower has completed the Department9s online entrance or exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan entrance or exit counseling requirements. Your school may also choose to provide entrance or exit counseling through an in-person session or (for entrance counseling) by providing a separate written form to the student that the student signs and returns to the school. If your school conducts in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions can help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive programs to ensure that students understand the terms and conditions of their loans. Counseling materials, such as the entrance and exit counseling guides, are available in the Financial Aid Toolkit. A school may adopt an alternative approach for entrance counseling as a part of its quality assurance plan.

Additionally, the NSLDS may show a 'Consolidation Loans, Unallocated' amount, which represents portions of a consolidation loan that cannot be attributed to other loans in the borrower's history, such as capitalized interest or non-Title IV loans.

"What are the requirements for entrance counseling for first-time Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers, and how does this relate to the aggregate loan limits for health professions students?","['<1-hop>\n\nEntrance Counseling Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. For this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student who requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before the authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan to a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling. Entrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are about to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person counseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. If entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable steps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the terms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the borrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic document. Your school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance education, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed. You may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance counseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements are reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that unreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling can include one or more of the following: Extra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods; A requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though you cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan); A requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or A requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', '<2-hop>\n\nteacher certification and preparatory coursework and the applicable annual loan limits.) Higher Aggregate Loan Limit for Certain Health Professions Students As explained earlier in this chapter, graduate and professional students who are enrolled in certain health professions programs are eligible for higher annual Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits. These students also have a higher combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit. The combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit for graduate and professional health professions students who are eligible to receive the increased annual unsubsidized amounts is $224,000. Not more than $65,500 of this amount may be from subsidized loans (see the notes following Table 4 above regarding the $65,500 subsidized aggregate loan limit for graduate and professional students). If a student who received increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts for a qualifying health profession program later enrolls in a non-health professions program, the student is no longer eligible for the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits. However, the additional loan amounts received for the health professions program are not counted toward the normal aggregate loan limit for that student. Checking Remaining Eligibility Under the Aggregate Loan Limits Before originating a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, it9s important to make sure the student still has remaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limits. As long as there is no conflicting information, you may rely on the financial aid history (provided on the ISIR as well as on the NSLDS Professional Access website) and the Transfer Student Monitoring process (for transfer students only) to tell you if a student is about to exceed the applicable aggregate loan limit. (See Volume 1, Chapter 3 for more detail on NSLDS financial aid history, which may also affect eligibility for other Title IV programs.) The Loan History in NSLDS for a borrower who has received Title IV loans shows Aggregate Loan Information for the borrower9s outstanding subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance amounts shown for a borrower in NSLDS do not include unpaid accrued interest, capitalized interest (unpaid interest that has been added to the principal balance of the loan), or other charges, as these amounts are not counted against the aggregate loan limits. For each individual loan that a borrower has received, NSLDS shows both the Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) and the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). The OPB is what the borrower owes, which may include capitalized interest and other charges. The Agg. OPB is the portion of the OPB that counts against the aggregate loan limits for subsidized and unsubsidized loans. For instance, suppose a student has a Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursed in the amount of $5,000. Over time, $200 in interest accrues and is capitalized. Assuming that the borrower has made no payments on the loan, the OPB on the loan will be $5,200 (this is the amount the borrower owes), and the Agg. OPB will be $5,000 (this is the amount that is counted against the aggregate loan limit). If you are looking at information in NSLDS for individual loans, it is the Agg. OPB that you should use to determine the student9s remaining loan eligibility under the applicable aggregate loan limit. The Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance amounts displayed in NSLDS for a borrower also include the outstanding portion of consolidation loans (both Direct Consolidation Loans and Federal Consolidation Loans made under the FFEL program) attributable to Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans, and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans that were repaid by the consolidation loan.']","Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers to ensure they understand the terms and conditions of the loan and their responsibility to repay it. This counseling can be conducted in-person, online, or through interactive electronic means, and schools must ensure students complete it. For health professions students, who are eligible for higher annual Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits, the aggregate loan limit is $224,000, with not more than $65,500 from subsidized loans. It is important to check a student's remaining eligibility under these aggregate loan limits before originating a Direct Subsidized Loan.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
