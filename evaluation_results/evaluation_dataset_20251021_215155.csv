What are the implications of 34 CFR 668.164(j)(3)(iii) for students who drop to less-than-half-time enrollment after receiving a Direct Loan disbursement?,"['Direct Loan Eligibility After an Enrollment Status Change If a student who received a disbursement of Direct Loan funds prior to the first day of classes of a payment period begins attendance on a less-than-half-time basis, there is no requirement for the school or the student to return the loan funds as long as: The student began attendance in at least one course during the payment period; and At the time of the loan disbursement the student was enrolled (registered) for classes on at least a half-time basis. However, the school must not make any subsequent disbursements of the loan unless the student resumes enrollment on at least a half-time basis during the payment period. A student who is no longer enrolled at least half time may not receive as a late disbursement any second or subsequent disbursement of the loan. Note that different requirements apply if a student who received a Direct Loan disbursement prior to the first day of classes fails to begin attendance in any classes. See <When A Student Fails to Begin Attendance= in Volume 4, Chapter 3. If a student does not withdraw but ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a school may make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred by the student for a period in which the student was eligible. However, this does not apply if the student dropped all future classes or modules, because the student never began classes as a half-time student. Title IV program funds (including Direct Loans) are disbursed to a student on the presumption that the student will attend the hours for which aid has been awarded. Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of a Direct Loan until a student has begun attendance in enough hours to establish half-time enrollment status. However, if a school has not yet made a Direct Loan disbursement to a student who has dropped classes, and the school determines that the student never began attendance in enough classes to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan to that student. Likewise, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules drops all future classes before beginning attendance in enough modules to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan because the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis. If a student who dropped to less-than-half-time status resumes enrollment on a half-time basis during the payment period or period of enrollment, the school may make remaining disbursements of a Direct Loan if the school documents (1) the student9s revised COA, and (2) that the student continues to qualify for the entire amount of the loan, despite any reduction in the student9s COA caused by the temporary cessation of enrollment on at least a half-time basis.

Is entrance counseling required for parents applying for a Direct PLUS Loan?,"['Entrance Counseling Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. For this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student who requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before the authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan to a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling. Entrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are about to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person counseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. If entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable steps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the terms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the borrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic document. Your school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance education, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed. You may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance counseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements are reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that unreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling can include one or more of the following: Extra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods; A requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though you cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan); A requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or A requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.']",Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.,single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

As stated above, Direct Loan exit counseling must provide borrowers with the information the Department makes available in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA. This section of the law requires the Department to make available to postsecondary schools and other entities a wide variety of information about federal student assistance programs, including information to help students assess the debt burden and repayment obligations that will be incurred as a result of receiving Title IV loans. As noted below under < Counseling Methods,= documentation that a borrower has completed the Department9s online exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan exit counseling requirements. Schools that choose to conduct their own exit counseling can meet the requirement to provide borrowers with the information made available by the Department in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA by providing borrowers with a copy of the Department9s Direct Loan Exit Counseling Guide. Providing Borrower Information at Separation Schools that conduct their own exit counseling must provide the current personal information collected from the student (name, address, references, etc.) to students9 loan servicers within 60 days. Students authorize their school to release information to servicers in the loan promissory note they signed. No further permission is needed. Students who complete online exit counseling on the Department9s StudentAid.gov website fulfill this requirement as part of the counseling session; NSLDS provides the information to the loan holders. Counseling Methods The Department offers Direct Loan Program online entrance and exit counseling for students on the StudentAid.gov website. Your school will receive notification through the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) (see <Required Electronic Processes= in Volume 2, Chapter 3 for more information) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers, and completion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If your school documents that borrowers have completed the Department9s online counseling, it has satisfied its counseling responsibility. Documentation that a borrower has completed the Department9s online entrance or exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan entrance or exit counseling requirements. Your school may also choose to provide entrance or exit counseling through an in-person session or (for entrance counseling) by providing a separate written form to the student that the student signs and returns to the school. If your school conducts in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions can help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive programs to ensure that students understand the terms and conditions of their loans.

Unlike the student, the student9s spouse will not be asked to report taxable college grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits. If the student or spouse had an amount to report, the student should have reported the joint total in the student section. The spouse will also not be asked about receipt of the earned income tax credit (EITC). Receipt of the EITC is used to determine if the student (or parent) is a single parent. If the student (or parent) is married, they are not a single parent, which makes it unnecessary to ask the spouse about the EITC. Student Spouse Consent, Approval, and Signature (29) Every student spouse contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid: Consent 3 The student spouse contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the IRS. Approval 3 The student spouse contributor must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may receive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).

The parent will be notified by email that they have been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The parent should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and password to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form.

How do changes in enrollment intensity and Pell recalculation policies affect a student's Pell Grant award?,"['<1-hop>\n\nChapter 7 Initial Calculations, Recalculations, and Overawards Initial Pell Calculation An initial calculation is the first calculation that is made on or after the date the school has received a Department- produced SAI such as the student9s initial FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR with an official SAI and a Pell Eligibility Flag of <Y=. This may be from a FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR, the FAFSA Partner Portal, or FAFSA.gov. The initial calculation uses the student9s enrollment intensity at the time of the calculation. If you9ve estimated the student9s eligibility before receiving a FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR for the student, you must confirm prior estimated eligibility or determine the student9s eligibility at the time you receive the FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR. If a school performs an initial calculation before a student has registered for specific classes, the school may rely on the student9s general estimate of intended enrollment when performing the initial calculation. For example, a school could perform an initial calculation using 50% enrollment intensity if a student indicated that they planned to enroll half time. You should document the date you initially calculate a student9s Pell Grant, which can be no earlier than the date your school received a Department-produced SAI. If you fail to document the date of the initial calculation, you must use the later of: The date the FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR is first received and the student9s enrollment intensity as of that date; or The date the student enrolls. Your school is considered to have received the ISIR on the date it was processed. This date is labeled <Processed Date= on the ISIR. In the case of a FAFSA Submission Summary, your school is considered to have received it on the date processed unless you document a later date. The processing date on a FAFSA Submission Summary is the date above the SAI. Pell Recalculation Due to Change in SAI or Other Pell Eligibility Indicators If the student9s SAI or one of the other Pell eligibility indicators change due to corrections, updates, or an adjustment, and the change would alter the amount of the Pell award, you must recalculate the Pell award for the entire award year. In addition to the SAI, these indicators include the Max Pell, Minimum Pell, CFH, or IASG indicators. If the student has received more than their Scheduled Award amount due to the recalculation, then the student has received an overpayment. In some cases, you may be able to adjust an award by reducing or canceling later payments to the student (see Volume 4, Chapter 3 for more information). A student selected for verification can be paid based on the corrected output document you receive during the <verification extension= (120 days after the student9s last day of enrollment, or the deadline date established by a Federal Register notice, whichever is earlier). For example, if you receive a reprocessed ISIR reflecting the results of the student9s verification during the extension period and the ISIR has a lower SAI than the previous ISIR (increasing the student9s eligibility), you calculate the student9s Pell Grant based on the reprocessed ISIR. If you receive a FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR with a SAI different from the one you used for the payment calculation, you must first decide which document is valid. If the new information is the correct information, the new FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR is the valid record. In most cases, you must recalculate the student9s Pell award for the entire award year based on the new SAI. For more information on FAFSA Submission Summaries, ISIRs, and SAI, see the Application and Verification Guide.', '<2-hop>\n\nenrollment intensity changes before the disbursement is made. If the student withdraws from all classes (or doesn9t begin attending any classes), you must follow the procedures discussed in Volume 5. Pell Recalculation Due to Change in COA When a student9s COA changes during the award year, and their enrollment intensity remains the same, you may (but are not required to) establish a policy under which you recalculate the student9s Pell Grant award. Once established, you must consistently apply such a recalculation policy to all students in the program. Tuition and Fee Charges and Recalculation If your school recalculates a student9s Pell Grant due to a change in enrollment intensity but continues to charge tuition and fees for credit hours that are no longer included in the student9s enrollment intensity for Pell Grant purposes, this does not affect the requirement to recalculate the student9s Pell Grant award. For example, if a student enrolls as a full-time student with 12 credits, but never starts attendance in a 3-credit class that starts after the school9s <add/drop= date, the student9s award must be recalculated based on 9 credits or 75% enrollment intensity. This is true, even though the school charges tuition for any classes dropped after the <add/ drop= date, and therefore continues to charge the student for 12 credits. Recalculation of Pell Grant Awards for Students Who Graduate Early From a Clock-Hour Program Under the regulations that govern the treatment of Title IV funds when a student withdraws, a student who completes all the requirements for graduation from a program before completing the days or hours they were scheduled to complete is not considered to have withdrawn, and no return of Title IV funds calculation is required (see Volume 5 for more detail). However, a school may be required to return a portion of the Pell Grant funds that were awarded to a student who successfully completes the requirements for graduation from a clock-hour program before completing the number of clock hours that they were scheduled to complete. Note that successfully completed clock hours may include a limited number of clock hours for which the student was granted an excused absence if your school has an excused absence policy that meets the requirements described in 34 CFR 668.4(e). For more information, see the discussion of ""Excused absences in clock-hour programs"" in Volume 3, Chapter 1. A student\'s eligibility to receive Title IV aid for a clock-hour program is based, in part, on the total number of clock hours in the program. If a school allows a student to graduate from a clock-hour program without completing all the originally established hours for the program, the school has effectively shortened the program length and reduced a student\'s Title IV aid eligibility for the program. In this circumstance, the school must recalculate the student\'s Pell Grant award based on the number of hours the student completed. The school must return to the Department the difference between the recalculated award amount and the Pell Grant amount that the student originally received. (For a student who received a Direct Loan, the school must also prorate the student\'s annual loan limit in this situation, or, if the loan limit was originally subject to proration, recalculate the original prorated loan limit. See Volume 8 for more information.)', ""<3-hop>\n\nVolume 7, Chapter 7, Example 5: Pell Recalculation for Early Graduation From a Clock-Hour Program Consider a student who enrolls in a 900 clock-hour program, with the academic year defined as 900 clock hours and 26 weeks of instructional time. The school assumes that the student will complete 900 clock hours, and the student9s Scheduled Award is $7,500, paid in disbursements of $3,750 in each payment period (see Chapter 1 of Volume 3 for guidance on determining payment periods). The school considers the student to have met the requirements for graduation from the program after the student has completed only 750 of the originally scheduled 900 clock hours. As soon as practicable after determining that the student will meet the graduation requirements, the school must recalculate the student's Pell Grant award as if the student had been enrolled in a 750 clock-hour program. Although the school will recalculate the student's award using Formula 4 (as described in Chapter 4), in this circumstance only the number of clock hours in the payment periods are considered. There is no comparison of hours and weeks fractions, as is normally required with Formula 4. The school determines the recalculated award amount for each payment period by multiplying the student's""]","Changes in enrollment intensity can lead to a recalculation of a student's Pell Grant award. If a student enrolls as a full-time student but does not begin attendance in all classes, the award must be recalculated based on the actual enrollment intensity. For example, if a student enrolls for 12 credits but only attends 9 credits, the award is recalculated based on 75% enrollment intensity. Additionally, if a student's SAI or other Pell eligibility indicators change, the Pell award must be recalculated for the entire award year. Schools may also establish policies to recalculate Pell Grants when a student's COA changes, provided the enrollment intensity remains the same. These recalculations ensure that the Pell Grant amount accurately reflects the student's current eligibility and enrollment status.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
How do Pell Grants and Title IV funds work for students in subscription-based programs?,"['<1-hop>\n\nboth the credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","In subscription-based programs, Pell Grants are disbursed based on the credit or clock hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period.

"How do changes in a student's enrollment intensity or status affect the recalculation of TEACH Grants, and what are the implications for disbursement timing in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs?","['<1-hop>\n\nboth the credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nrecalculating Pell Grants and TEACH Grants when a student9s enrollment intensity or status changes within a term or period of enrollment, the policy must be applied consistently to all students. Therefore, if your school chooses to recalculate Pell Grants and TEACH Grants for a student whose enrollment intensity or enrollment status in a program increases (for example, from half-time to full-time), it must also recalculate for a student whose enrollment intensity or status decreases. Once you have recalculated a student9s eligibility, Title IV funds in excess of the amount the student is eligible to receive must be returned or re-awarded, as applicable. For guidance on handling excess cash resulting from recalculations of aid eligibility due to enrollment intensity or status changes, see Volume 4, Chapter 1. Recalculation and Direct Loans If a student9s enrollment status changes after the student has already received one or more Direct Loan disbursements, no recalculation of the previously disbursed Direct Loan amount is required. For information on how changes in enrollment status may affect a student9s eligibility to receive pending Direct Loan disbursements, see Volume 8, Chapter 1. Recalculation and Pell Grants Since Pell Grants are always based on the full-time COA, recalculation means that you are looking at the student9s revised enrollment intensity. For more detail on recalculating Pell Grants, see Volume 7, Chapter 7. Recalculating COA When performing a recalculation a school may not include in the COA costs associated with any classes the student failed to begin. In addition, in determining a student9s COA a school may not include any costs for a period when the student was not enrolled in and attending any Title IV eligible classes (other than costs for a brief period between regularly scheduled terms or semesters). Note that some components of COA are not included if a student is enrolled less than half time (see Chapter 2 of this volume). A school that performs a Return of Title IV Funds calculation on a period of enrollment basis for a student enrolled in a program offered in modules may not include in the recalculated COA any costs associated with a future payment period for which the student has not confirmed attendance at the time of withdrawal and that does not start within 45 days. COA Changes Between or Within Payment Periods A school may have a policy of recalculating awards only when the COA changes from one payment period to the next, and not when the COA changes within a payment period. For example, a school could recalculate awards because of changes to a student9s tuition and fee costs or living situation (e.g., when a student moves off campus) between payment periods. However, schools also have the option to establish a policy of recalculating financial aid awards when a student9s costs change within a payment period. For instance, if a student with no dependents moves from a dormitory to off-campus housing at midterm, a school could choose to recalculate the student9s award for that payment period. For Pell Grant purposes, such a policy is acceptable if it9s carried out for all students whose costs change within the payment period. Note that schools are not limited to one or the other of the policies described above. Schools may have a policy of recalculating awards when there is a change in costs at any time during an award year (whether within a payment period or between payment periods), as long as the recalculation policy is carried out for all students whose costs change. Schools may not recalculate the payment for a payment period that took place before the cost change. For instance, if a student lives in the dormitory during the first quarter and then moves off campus for the second and third quarters, the recalculation would only affect the payments for the second and third quarters.']","Changes in a student's enrollment intensity or status necessitate the recalculation of TEACH Grants to ensure consistency across all students. If a student's enrollment status changes, such as moving from half-time to full-time, the school must recalculate the TEACH Grant eligibility. This recalculation ensures that Title IV funds are adjusted to reflect the student's current enrollment status, and any excess funds must be returned or re-awarded. In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, the timing of disbursements for TEACH Grants is based on the scheduled payment periods established at the beginning of the program. These periods do not change even if a student completes additional weeks or hours. However, if a student accelerates their progression, it may affect their Direct Loan eligibility, requiring proration of the loan limit in the final academic year. Therefore, while recalculations ensure accurate grant amounts based on enrollment status, they do not alter the disbursement schedule in these programs.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"What are the requirements for entrance counseling for first-time student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers, and how does verification affect the disbursement of Direct Loans?","['<1-hop>\n\nEntrance Counseling Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. For this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student who requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before the authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan to a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling. Entrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are about to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person counseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. If entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable steps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the terms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the borrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic document. Your school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance education, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed. You may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance counseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements are reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that unreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling can include one or more of the following: Extra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods; A requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though you cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan); A requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or A requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', '<2-hop>\n\nOriginate or disburse any additional Direct Loans (subsidized, unsubsidized, or PLUS). The student must repay any FSEOG funds received that year. If the student fails to complete verification within your school9s established timeframe and if you received any Direct Subsidized Loan funds for the student that you did not disburse, you must return some or all those funds under the excess cash tolerance regulation (see Volume 4, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook). If the student provides the required documentation after your school9s deadline, you may, at your discretion, provide aid if still within the Department9s overall verification deadlines. Pell Grants A student selected for verification may submit a valid FAFSA Submission Summary or a school can receive a valid ISIR after the Pell deadline but before the verification deadline published in the Federal Register. If a student does not provide the verification documentation or you do not receive the valid FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR (if necessary) within this additional time, they lose their Pell Grant eligibility for the award year and must return any Pell money already received for that year. Other Considerations The Department may determine not to process the FAFSA form of an applicant who has been requested to provide documentation until they do so, or the Department decides there is no longer a need for it. A Pell applicant selected for verification must complete the process by the deadline published in the Federal Register. The notice for the 2024-25 award year was published on September 18, 2024. The deadline for the 2024-25 award year is September 20, 2025, or 120 days after the last day of the student9s enrollment, whichever is earlier. When the notice for 2025-26 is published, the corresponding deadline date is expected to be mid-September 2026. Applicants to Campus- Based programs and the Direct Loan program must complete verification by the same deadline or by an earlier one your aid office establishes. Verification is complete when you have all the requested documentation and a valid ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary (one on which all the information is accurate and complete). This includes any necessary corrections, which must be made by the Federal Register deadlines for submitting paper or electronic corrections. Late and Post-Withdrawal Disbursements Generally, a student ceases to be eligible for aid once they have finished the payment period and/or is no longer enrolled. However, the student may submit verification documentation and receive a late disbursement after that time if the Department processed a FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR with an official SAI while they were still enrolled. For information on late disbursements, see Volume 4 of the FSA Handbook; for more information on post-withdrawal disbursements, see Volume 5. Verification Status Codes When you disburse a Pell Grant, you must report the student9s verification status through the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) System even if they were not selected for verification. V4You have verified the student. This includes students selected by the FPS and those your school chose to verify based on its own criteria.']","Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers, which includes providing comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan and the borrower's responsibility to repay it.

The normal payment period disbursement rules do not apply in this situation. The next loan period and a new BBAY 3 at the new school begins the day after the last day of the abbreviated loan period. Once the new loan period and BBAY 3 begin, all normal rules for the timing of disbursements and annual loan limit progression apply. Examples 2 and 3 illustrate the principles described above. Although this is not shown in the abbreviated loan period examples, in some cases a student who transfers into a program after having received a loan at another school for an overlapping academic year may be eligible to receive a higher total loan amount for the program at the new school than a non-transfer student would be eligible to receive for that same program. In other cases, a transfer student may be eligible to receive a lower total loan amount for the same program than a non-transfer student. The total loan amount that a transfer student may receive depends on factors such as the length of the program at the second school, the program9s COA, and the loan amount the transfer student received at the prior school for the overlapping academic year. Exceptions to the Minimum Loan Period Rules (Abbreviated Loan Periods) 34 CFR 685.301(a)(10)(ii), (iii) Volume 8, Chapter 7, Example 2: Transfer Into a Clock-Hour Program One Academic Year or Greater in Length A dependent first-year undergraduate student receives the first disbursement ($2,750) of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan at School A. The loan period and academic year dates are April 1 to December 31. For purposes of this example, assume that the student has no financial need for a Direct Subsidized Loan and receives only Direct Unsubsidized Loans. The student transfers from School A to an 1,800 clock-hour program at School B and begins attendance on June 25. The student is still classified as a dependent first-year undergraduate. The program at School B has an academic year of 26 weeks of instructional time and 900 clock hours. The student9s first loan period at School B will be an abbreviated loan period from June 25 (the beginning date of attendance at School B) through December 31 (the date the academic year would have ended at School A). For the initial abbreviated loan period, School B may originate a loan for up to the difference between the student9s annual loan limit ($5,500) and the loan already received at School A for the overlapping loan period ($2,750). The loan amount available to the student during the abbreviated loan period is $2,750. On January 1, the day after the last day of the abbreviated loan period, a new BBAY 3 begins, and the student becomes eligible for a new annual loan limit. The loan period for the new loan the student receives following the completion of the abbreviated loan period will correspond to the lesser of the academic year or the remainder of the program at School B. If there is less than a full academic year of the program remaining after the abbreviated loan period has ended, the loan limit for the new loan must be prorated.', '<2-hop>\n\nVolume 8, Chapter 6, Example 2: BBAY 1 Where the SAY Contains Two Semesters Year 1: SAY or BBAY 1 Year 2: BBAY 1 Year 3: BBAY 1 Fall + Spring Summer + Fall Spring + Summer In Example 2, the initial fall and spring terms could be considered either an SAY or BBAY 1.

"How does the eligibility for Direct PLUS Loans affect the loan limits for a dependent undergraduate student, and what options are available if a parent borrower passes away during the loan period?","['<1-hop>\n\nEffect of a Change in Student Status on Aggregate Loan Limits In some cases, a student may qualify for higher loan limits but then lose eligibility for the higher limits due to a change in status. One such situation is when a dependent undergraduate qualifies for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, but in a subsequent academic year the student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan. In this circumstance the dependent student no longer qualifies for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. During any academic year when a dependent student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student is subject to the dependent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student otherwise would have been eligible to receive under the dependent undergraduate annual loan limits are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the $31,000 combined subsidized and unsubsidized dependent undergraduate aggregate limit (see Example 3 below). A similar situation occurs when a student who received loans for a graduate or professional degree program later returns to school and enrolls in an undergraduate program. The student is then subject to the undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student previously received as an undergraduate are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the undergraduate aggregate loan limit (see Example 2 earlier in this chapter). Volume 8, Chapter 4, Example 3: Aggregate Loan Limits and Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Amounts When Parents Are Unable To Obtain Direct PLUS Loans A dependent student receives additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the additional amounts available to independent undergraduates) for the first three years of a four-year program because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan for each of those years. For each of the first three years, the student receives the maximum subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts under the independent student annual loan limits (remember that the annual subsidized maximums are the same for dependent and independent undergraduates): First Year (independent student loan limit) $3,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Second Year (independent student loan limit) $4,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Third Year (independent student loan limit) $5,500 subsidized $7,000 unsubsidized ($5,000 more than dependent maximum) Total $13,500 subsidized $19,000 unsubsidized ($13,000 more than dependent maximum) In the fourth year, the parent is eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, so the student is then subject to the annual and aggregate loan limits for a dependent undergraduate. The dependent student received a total of $13,500 in Direct Subsidized Loan funds and $19,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds ($32,500 combined subsidized and unsubsidized total) for the first three years when the student9s parent was unable to obtain Direct PLUS Loans.

If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent student (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4 of this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.']","The eligibility for Direct PLUS Loans significantly impacts the loan limits for a dependent undergraduate student. If a parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the dependent student may qualify for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts, similar to those available to independent undergraduates. For example, in the first three years of a four-year program, if the parent cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the student can receive up to $13,500 in subsidized loans and $19,000 in unsubsidized loans, which are higher than the dependent maximums. However, if in the fourth year the parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student is then subject to the dependent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. In the unfortunate event that a parent borrower passes away during the loan period, the school may need to return any disbursed Direct PLUS Loan funds. If there is no surviving parent to take out a new Direct PLUS Loan, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, up to the amounts typically available to independent undergraduates.
