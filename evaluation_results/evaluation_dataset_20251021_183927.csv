Direct Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form If you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information sections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the student, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up to the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent second-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume for information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of the other Title IV programs. Self-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or have refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated statement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students without parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide. Direct PLUS Loans Direct PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate students. A parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who meets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a student. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent who had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements outlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal government holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s ineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student is otherwise eligible. Requirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers Schools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan Program and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available to both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit Direct PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students.

However, the school must not make any subsequent disbursements of the loan unless the student resumes enrollment on at least a half-time basis during the payment period. A student who is no longer enrolled at least half time may not receive as a late disbursement any second or subsequent disbursement of the loan. Note that different requirements apply if a student who received a Direct Loan disbursement prior to the first day of classes fails to begin attendance in any classes. See <When A Student Fails to Begin Attendance= in Volume 4, Chapter 3. If a student does not withdraw but ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a school may make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred by the student for a period in which the student was eligible. However, this does not apply if the student dropped all future classes or modules, because the student never began classes as a half-time student. Title IV program funds (including Direct Loans) are disbursed to a student on the presumption that the student will attend the hours for which aid has been awarded. Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of a Direct Loan until a student has begun attendance in enough hours to establish half-time enrollment status. However, if a school has not yet made a Direct Loan disbursement to a student who has dropped classes, and the school determines that the student never began attendance in enough classes to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan to that student. Likewise, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules drops all future classes before beginning attendance in enough modules to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan because the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis.

"How do unallocated consolidation loan amounts affect a student's eligibility for Direct Loans, and what role does teacher certification play in determining loan limits?","['<1-hop>\n\nteacher certification and preparatory coursework and the applicable annual loan limits.) Higher Aggregate Loan Limit for Certain Health Professions Students As explained earlier in this chapter, graduate and professional students who are enrolled in certain health professions programs are eligible for higher annual Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits. These students also have a higher combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit. The combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit for graduate and professional health professions students who are eligible to receive the increased annual unsubsidized amounts is $224,000. Not more than $65,500 of this amount may be from subsidized loans (see the notes following Table 4 above regarding the $65,500 subsidized aggregate loan limit for graduate and professional students). If a student who received increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts for a qualifying health profession program later enrolls in a non-health professions program, the student is no longer eligible for the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits. However, the additional loan amounts received for the health professions program are not counted toward the normal aggregate loan limit for that student. Checking Remaining Eligibility Under the Aggregate Loan Limits Before originating a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, it9s important to make sure the student still has remaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limits. As long as there is no conflicting information, you may rely on the financial aid history (provided on the ISIR as well as on the NSLDS Professional Access website) and the Transfer Student Monitoring process (for transfer students only) to tell you if a student is about to exceed the applicable aggregate loan limit. (See Volume 1, Chapter 3 for more detail on NSLDS financial aid history, which may also affect eligibility for other Title IV programs.) The Loan History in NSLDS for a borrower who has received Title IV loans shows Aggregate Loan Information for the borrower9s outstanding subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance amounts shown for a borrower in NSLDS do not include unpaid accrued interest, capitalized interest (unpaid interest that has been added to the principal balance of the loan), or other charges, as these amounts are not counted against the aggregate loan limits. For each individual loan that a borrower has received, NSLDS shows both the Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) and the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). The OPB is what the borrower owes, which may include capitalized interest and other charges. The Agg. OPB is the portion of the OPB that counts against the aggregate loan limits for subsidized and unsubsidized loans. For instance, suppose a student has a Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursed in the amount of $5,000. Over time, $200 in interest accrues and is capitalized. Assuming that the borrower has made no payments on the loan, the OPB on the loan will be $5,200 (this is the amount the borrower owes), and the Agg. OPB will be $5,000 (this is the amount that is counted against the aggregate loan limit). If you are looking at information in NSLDS for individual loans, it is the Agg. OPB that you should use to determine the student9s remaining loan eligibility under the applicable aggregate loan limit. The Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance amounts displayed in NSLDS for a borrower also include the outstanding portion of consolidation loans (both Direct Consolidation Loans and Federal Consolidation Loans made under the FFEL program) attributable to Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans, and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans that were repaid by the consolidation loan.', '<2-hop>\n\nUnallocated Consolidation Loan Amounts NSLDS may also show a <Consolidation Loans, Unallocated= amount that is not counted against a borrower9s aggregate loan limits.

For example, it may represent capitalized interest or non-Title IV loans that were consolidated. You are not responsible for determining the origin of any unallocated consolidation loan amounts.

How does module enrollment intensity affect Pell Grant eligibility for a student enrolled in a summer session with combined modules?,"['<1-hop>\n\nPell Grant COA for Summer Terms Costs used to determine Pell Grant eligibility for summer terms are figured in the same way as for any other payment period; that is, the costs are based on the costs for a full-time student for a full academic year. If your school has fall and spring semesters that comprise an academic year, you can9t add the costs for the summer term to the costs for the fall and spring semesters. The award for the summer term is still based on the costs for one academic year. However, if the academic year definition includes the summer term, then the costs for the summer term must be included in the cost for a full academic year. If the student was previously enrolled in the award year, you may be able to use the same Pell Grant COA for the summer term that you used for the immediately preceding term that the student attended. However, this isn9t possible if the costs are different from the fall through spring, such as a different tuition charge per credit hour, or if you are required to recalculate the Pell Grant COA. If it9s necessary to base the student9s Pell Grant COA on the summer term, you must prorate the summer costs to the length of an academic year to establish the cost for a full academic year. See Chapter 3 of this volume for additional information on prorating costs in the Pell Grant program. If the summer session is the first term in the award year for that student (for example, your school is paying a student for the summer 2025 term from the 2025-26 award year), you must establish the student9s full-year cost based on the costs for the summer term. If the student enrolls in another term in that award year, you may have to recalculate the student9s costs for the later term. Receiving Less Than the Scheduled Award Due to Crossover A student may also receive less than a Scheduled Award in an award year if the student9s program crosses award years and the student9s Pell Grant award in one of the award years is for a portion of the program that is less than a full academic year. For example, if a student9s last term of enrollment to complete their academic program is summer 2025, and the school treats the payment period as a header to the 2025-26 academic year, the student may receive a Pell Grant disbursement for that one payment period, which will be less than the student9s full Scheduled Award for 2025-26. Crossover Pell and Withdrawal For details on how to perform Return of Title IV Funds calculations in a crossover Pell situation, see Volume 5, Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook. Summer Modules If a term-based school offers a series of modules that overlap two award years, these modules may be combined and treated as one term. Schools are not required to combine modules. However, if you do not combine the modules to create a single term and the modules overlap, the program must be considered a non-term program. When you combine modules into a single term (i.e., payment period), the weeks of instructional time in the combined term are the weeks of instructional time from the beginning of the first module to the date the last module ends. The student9s enrollment intensity for the entire payment period must be calculated based on the total number of credits the student is projected to take for all modules.

If one parent dies, the student is still a dependent of the remaining biological or adoptive parent, not the stepparent. If parents are divorced or never married and not living together, the parent on the FAFSA form should be the parent who provided more than 50% of the financial support for the student during the last 12 months. This may be different from the parent the student lived with during that same period. If one parent pays child support and/or alimony to the other parent, the amount paid counts for the payer when determining which parent provided more than 50% of the student9s financial support and is a required contributor on the FAFSA form. Once the parent who provides more than 50% of the financial support for the student has been determined, that parent (and their current spouse, if applicable) should report their financial information on the student9s FAFSA form as a contributor. If neither parent provided more than 50% of the financial support for the student (including when neither parent provided support for the student) during the last 12 months, the parent with the greater income and assets is a required contributor on the FAFSA form. Once the parent with the greater income and assets has been determined, that parent (and their current spouse, if applicable) should report their financial information on the student9s FAFSA form.

Crossover Payment From the Proper Award Year For Pell purposes, you must consider a crossover payment period to occur entirely within one award year and calculate the student9s Pell award and disburse Pell funds from the award year selected. If you only have a valid FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR from one award year, you must rely on that record and the award year to which the valid FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR pertains.

Although you may assign a crossover payment period to either of the relevant award years (subject to the limitations described below), you must make the assignment based on what you determine will be most beneficial to students. You may assign the Pell Grant award to a different award year than the rest of the student9s Title IV aid.

Pell Grants A student selected for verification may submit a valid FAFSA Submission Summary or a school can receive a valid ISIR after the Pell deadline but before the verification deadline published in the Federal Register. If a student does not provide the verification documentation or you do not receive the valid FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR (if necessary) within this additional time, they lose their Pell Grant eligibility for the award year and must return any Pell money already received for that year. Other Considerations The Department may determine not to process the FAFSA form of an applicant who has been requested to provide documentation until they do so, or the Department decides there is no longer a need for it. A Pell applicant selected for verification must complete the process by the deadline published in the Federal Register. The notice for the 2024-25 award year was published on September 18, 2024. The deadline for the 2024-25 award year is September 20, 2025, or 120 days after the last day of the student9s enrollment, whichever is earlier. When the notice for 2025-26 is published, the corresponding deadline date is expected to be mid-September 2026. Applicants to Campus- Based programs and the Direct Loan program must complete verification by the same deadline or by an earlier one your aid office establishes. Verification is complete when you have all the requested documentation and a valid ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary (one on which all the information is accurate and complete). This includes any necessary corrections, which must be made by the Federal Register deadlines for submitting paper or electronic corrections. Late and Post-Withdrawal Disbursements Generally, a student ceases to be eligible for aid once they have finished the payment period and/or is no longer enrolled. However, the student may submit verification documentation and receive a late disbursement after that time if the Department processed a FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR with an official SAI while they were still enrolled. For information on late disbursements, see Volume 4 of the FSA Handbook; for more information on post-withdrawal disbursements, see Volume 5.

What are the implications of not completing verification for Pell Grant eligibility and how does it affect the aid package when combined with other Title IV and non-Title IV aid?,"[""<1-hop>\n\nPrior to the 2024-2025 award year, the HEA allowed schools to use alternate expected family contributions (EFCs) when packaging aid for periods other than nine months. The FAFSA Simplification Act eliminated this provision. Beginning with the 2024-2025 award year, when packaging aid for any period that is not nine months, schools must use a student9s calculated 9-month SAI in the formula to determine eligibility for need-based aid, as described above (that is, COA 3 SAI 3 OFA = need). As a result of this change, students who are enrolled for periods shorter than nine months will have less financial need than would have been the case in the past when using an alternate (smaller) EFC for such periods. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more information on how this change may affect Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for students receiving loans for periods of enrollment (loan periods) shorter than nine months. Treatment of Negative SAIs A student may have a calculated SAI that is a negative number as low as -1,500. Also, as explained in Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide, certain students will automatically receive a -1,500 SAI. When packaging need-based aid for students with negative SAIs, schools must convert any negative SAIs to zero for awarding purposes. This means that a negative SAI will not increase the amount of need-based aid a student can receive. Note that a negative SAI also does not increase the amount of non-need-based aid that a student may receive because the SAI is not a factor in determining eligibility for aid that isn9t based on financial need. Packaging Rules Pell Grants as the First Source of Aid Pell Grants are the first source of aid for a student, and packaging Title IV funds begins with determining a student9s Pell Grant eligibility, as described in Volume 7. A correctly determined Pell Grant is never adjusted to take into account other forms of aid. When awarding aid from the other Title IV programs, you must ensure that the student9s need or COA is not exceeded. In some cases, a student9s aid package may include a Pell Grant and non-Title IV aid (for example, institutional aid or private education loans), but no other types of Title IV aid, and the combination of the Pell Grant and the other aid may be large enough to exceed the student9s COA. For instance, the National Collegiate Athletic Association9s (NCAA's) rules for athletic aid may permit a school to award athletic aid that covers a student9s full COA (see <NCAA Considerations= in Chapter 2 of this volume for more information). In this case, the student is still eligible for the full amount of the Pell Grant. However, you can9t award any Title IV funds other than the Pell Grant. Note that in some cases a student9s SAI may be higher than the COA, resulting in no financial need, but the student may still qualify for a calculated Pell Grant or a minimum Pell Grant (see Volume 7, Chapter 2 for more information on Pell Grant eligibility criteria). As an example, consider a student with an SAI of 6,650, a COA of $5,500, and a calculated Pell Grant amount of $745. In this circumstance the student is still eligible for the full Pell Grant amount (as long as it doesn9t exceed the COA), but you may not award any other types of need-based Title IV aid. If a student9s aid package includes a Pell Grant, other types of Title IV aid, and non-Title IV aid, and the total aid amount exceeds the student9s COA, the student still qualifies for the full Pell Grant amount, but you must adjust the other Title IV aid to ensure that the COA is not exceeded. In the circumstances described above you may (but are not required to) adjust non-Title IV aid over which you have control in accordance with your school9s policies."", '<2-hop>\n\nOriginate or disburse any additional Direct Loans (subsidized, unsubsidized, or PLUS).

FAFSA Simplification Act The FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a significant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need analysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the FAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process. Changes From the FUTURE Act The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data exchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate completing the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX eliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information reported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered verified for Title IV purposes. Unlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s spouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via the FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid. Other Changes Throughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references have been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year. Where appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been properly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers.

How do the minimum loan periods for Direct Loans relate to the FAFSA family size determination process as outlined in Chapter 1 and Chapter 5?,"['<1-hop>\n\nMinimum Loan Periods The minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar. As explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on whether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard or nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the case of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below. Nonstandard terms may be one of the following types: 1. Nonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any other term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length. SE9W Period of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition 34 CFR 685.102(b)', '<2-hop>\n\nequal the tax filer(s) plus dependents) claimed on an individual9s tax return. Individuals who complete the FAFSA form online, provide the required consent and approval to retrieve and use IRS FTI, and have their tax data successfully transferred via the FA-DDX will not be asked to report the size of their family as their family size will be derived from that FTI. Instead, these individuals will be asked if their family size is different from the number of individuals claimed on their tax return. If they indicate there was a change, they will be asked to manually report their number of dependents in a follow-up question. On the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, family size appears in both the student and parent contributor sections. Dependent students are instructed to skip Question 9 on the paper (PDF) FAFSA form. Dependent students completing the online FAFSA form will not see the family size question in the student section. The following persons are included in the family size of an independent student: The student and their spouse, unless the spouse has died or is not living in the household due to separation or divorce. The student9s dependent children, if they live with the student (or live apart from the student due to a qualifying temporary absence under IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment) and will receive more than half of their support from the student (and spouse) from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026. Unborn children should not be included in the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive more than half of their support from the student (and spouse) during the award year. Other persons, who live with and receive more than half their support from the student and will receive more than half support for the entire award year. For FAFSA forms submitted after the start of the year, see the relevant paragraph and example about legal dependents provided earlier in this chapter under the <Children and Legal Dependents= section. Number in College (10) While number in college is no longer used to calculate a student9s SAI, the FAFSA Simplification Act requires the question to be included on the FAFSA form. Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment for a student. See <Professional Judgment= in Chapter 5 of this volume for additional information. The student is always included in the number in college. Also included are those in the family size who are or will be enrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school. Student Demographic Information (11) and Student Race and Ethnicity (12) These questions collect sex/gender and race/ethnicity information about the student. The answers to these questions will not affect the student9s eligibility for federal student aid, be used in any calculations, or be shared with the schools to which the student applies.
