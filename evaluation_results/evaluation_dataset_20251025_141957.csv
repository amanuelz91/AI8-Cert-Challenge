What are Direct Subsidized Loans?,"['information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07. Direct Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form If you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information sections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the student, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up to the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent second-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume for information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of the other Title IV programs. Self-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or have refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated statement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students without parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide. Direct PLUS Loans Direct PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate students. A parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who meets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a student. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent who had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements outlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal government holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s ineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student is otherwise eligible. Requirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers Schools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan Program and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available to both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit Direct PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students. For more information, see the discussion under <Direct PLUS Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.']","The context does not provide specific information about Direct Subsidized Loans, but it mentions that dependent undergraduate students whose parents refuse to complete the FAFSA form or have ended financial support may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
"What role does the Cost of Attendance (COA) play in determining a student's financial aid eligibility, and how are allowable costs factored into this calculation?","['<1-hop>\n\nChapter 2 Cost of Attendance (Budget) Awards for most of the Title IV programs are based on some form of financial need. Unlike scholarship programs that may award funds based on academic merit or the student9s field of study, <need-based= grants, loans, and work-study are based on the student9s demonstrated financial need for assistance. The cost of attendance (COA) is the cornerstone of establishing a student9s financial need, as it sets a limit on the total aid that a student may receive for purposes of the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, and is one of the basic components of the Pell Grant calculation. This chapter picks up at the point where the Student Aid Index (SAI) for a student has been determined. See Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide for more information on the SAI, and Volume 1 for more information on basic student eligibility requirements. Most schools establish average costs for different categories of students and set these cost categories in EDExpress or other software that they use to determine awards and package aid. The typical costs that you establish for your students will be used to calculate their Title IV award amounts and package their aid.', '<2-hop>\n\nAllowable Costs The HEA specifies the types of costs that are included in the COA, but each school must determine the appropriate and reasonable amounts to include for each eligible COA category for its students, based on the criteria described in this chapter. The COA for a student is an estimate of that student9s educational expenses for the period of enrollment. As you9ll see, in most cases you can use average expenses (for students with the same enrollment status) at your school, rather than actual expenses. For example, for the tuition and fees component, you can use the same average amount for all full-time students instead of figuring the actual tuition and fees for each individual student. You can have different standard costs for different categories of students, such as one COA for out-of-state students, who are charged higher tuition, and a different COA for in-state students, who are charged lower tuition. However, you cannot combine the COA figures for each separate enrollment status and award aid to a student based on the average COA. Students must be awarded based on a COA comprised of allowable costs assessed all students carrying the same academic workload. If a student is enrolled in a program that has extra fees or costs, such as lab fees, you can add those fees to the student9s cost or use a standard cost that you9ve established for all students in that program. If you establish standard cost categories, you must apply the cost allowances uniformly to all students in those categories. There are a variety of methods to arrive at average costs for your students, such as conducting periodic surveys of your student population, assessing local housing costs or other pertinent data, or other reasonable methods you may devise which generate accurate average costs for various categories of students. The types of costs that may be included are the same for all Title IV programs. For the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, the COA, based on the student9s enrollment status, is a student9s cost for the period for which the aid is intended. For Pell Grants, the COA is always the full-year costs for a full-time student, so you may have to prorate actual or average costs up for students who are attending less than an academic year (or who are less than full time in a term-based program) or prorate down for students who are attending for periods longer than an academic year. Note that though certain components are excluded from the Pell Grant COA for a student who is enrolled on a less-than-half-time basis, the components that are included in the less-than-half-time Pell Grant COA are still based on the full-year costs for a full-time student for a Pell Grant recipient with an enrollment intensity below 50%. See Volume 7 for guidance on Pell Grant requirements. The types of costs included in the COA are determined by section 472 of the HEA and are the only costs that may be included in a student9s COA. If a cost is not listed below, it may not be included as part of the COA. Unless it is specifically noted in the discussion of COA categories below that a particular category applies only to students who are enrolled at least half time, the types of expenses that may be included in the COA are the same for all students, regardless of enrollment status.']","The Cost of Attendance (COA) is crucial in determining a student's financial aid eligibility as it sets a limit on the total aid a student may receive for programs like Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs. It is a fundamental component in calculating a student's financial need, which is necessary for awarding need-based grants, loans, and work-study. The COA is an estimate of a student's educational expenses for the enrollment period and includes allowable costs as specified by the Higher Education Act (HEA). Schools must determine appropriate and reasonable amounts for each COA category based on criteria such as enrollment status and may use average expenses for students with similar enrollment statuses. Allowable costs are standardized and must be applied uniformly to all students within the same category, ensuring that aid is awarded based on a COA comprised of these allowable costs.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How does the FAFSA Simplification Act impact the calculation of student aid for periods shorter than nine months, and what role does the FUTURE Act play in verifying income and tax information for FAFSA applicants?","[""<1-hop>\n\nPrior to the 2024-2025 award year, the HEA allowed schools to use alternate expected family contributions (EFCs) when packaging aid for periods other than nine months. The FAFSA Simplification Act eliminated this provision. Beginning with the 2024-2025 award year, when packaging aid for any period that is not nine months, schools must use a student9s calculated 9-month SAI in the formula to determine eligibility for need-based aid, as described above (that is, COA 3 SAI 3 OFA = need). As a result of this change, students who are enrolled for periods shorter than nine months will have less financial need than would have been the case in the past when using an alternate (smaller) EFC for such periods. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more information on how this change may affect Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for students receiving loans for periods of enrollment (loan periods) shorter than nine months. Treatment of Negative SAIs A student may have a calculated SAI that is a negative number as low as -1,500. Also, as explained in Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide, certain students will automatically receive a -1,500 SAI. When packaging need-based aid for students with negative SAIs, schools must convert any negative SAIs to zero for awarding purposes. This means that a negative SAI will not increase the amount of need-based aid a student can receive. Note that a negative SAI also does not increase the amount of non-need-based aid that a student may receive because the SAI is not a factor in determining eligibility for aid that isn9t based on financial need. Packaging Rules Pell Grants as the First Source of Aid Pell Grants are the first source of aid for a student, and packaging Title IV funds begins with determining a student9s Pell Grant eligibility, as described in Volume 7. A correctly determined Pell Grant is never adjusted to take into account other forms of aid. When awarding aid from the other Title IV programs, you must ensure that the student9s need or COA is not exceeded. In some cases, a student9s aid package may include a Pell Grant and non-Title IV aid (for example, institutional aid or private education loans), but no other types of Title IV aid, and the combination of the Pell Grant and the other aid may be large enough to exceed the student9s COA. For instance, the National Collegiate Athletic Association9s (NCAA's) rules for athletic aid may permit a school to award athletic aid that covers a student9s full COA (see <NCAA Considerations= in Chapter 2 of this volume for more information). In this case, the student is still eligible for the full amount of the Pell Grant. However, you can9t award any Title IV funds other than the Pell Grant. Note that in some cases a student9s SAI may be higher than the COA, resulting in no financial need, but the student may still qualify for a calculated Pell Grant or a minimum Pell Grant (see Volume 7, Chapter 2 for more information on Pell Grant eligibility criteria). As an example, consider a student with an SAI of 6,650, a COA of $5,500, and a calculated Pell Grant amount of $745. In this circumstance the student is still eligible for the full Pell Grant amount (as long as it doesn9t exceed the COA), but you may not award any other types of need-based Title IV aid. If a student9s aid package includes a Pell Grant, other types of Title IV aid, and non-Title IV aid, and the total aid amount exceeds the student9s COA, the student still qualifies for the full Pell Grant amount, but you must adjust the other Title IV aid to ensure that the COA is not exceeded. In the circumstances described above you may (but are not required to) adjust non-Title IV aid over which you have control in accordance with your school9s policies."", '<2-hop>\n\nVerification Following Disasters The Dear Colleague Letter GEN-17-08 gives general guidance for awarding aid in federally declared disasters. It states that the Secretary will not enforce the verification requirements during the award year for applicants whose records were lost or destroyed because of a disaster if the school has tried to preserve and reconstruct any records. The school must document when it does not perform verification for this reason and use status code <S= when reporting the disbursement of Pell Grants to affected students. Also, the requirement for dependent students to submit a statement signed by a parent regarding family size is waived if the parents cannot provide the signature due to the disaster. The school must note why no parent was able to provide the statement. Schools that experience a local disaster (rather than a federally declared one) that affects Title IV administration should consult their regional school participation division. Acceptable Documentation The FAFSA Simplification Act requires that, wherever possible, the Department use data received directly from the IRS to calculate a student9s SAI and Pell Grant award. The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act (FUTURE Act) requires the Department of Education to access tax information held by the IRS pertaining to FAFSA applicants4and, where applicable, their parents and spouses4through a secure method: the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX). The FUTURE Act amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to mandate the disclosure of FTI directly from the IRS to the Department with an individual9s consent and approval. The FUTURE Act also made providing consent and approval for the exchange of FTI a requirement for receiving federal student aid. Applicants and contributors will be required to provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI directly from the IRS. When FTI is received from the IRS via the FA-DDX, the FTI received is considered verified and no additional documentation is necessary. As a result, the FA-DDX is the fastest, easiest, and most secure method of meeting income and tax verification requirements. The September 4, 2024 Federal Register Notice gives the documentation required for verifying 2025-26 application data, which depends on the item verified, as explained in this section. If you use a verification document, be sure that it is signed, that all required sections are completed, and that any relevant tax or alternative documents are attached. Copies of original documents are acceptable. An original signature on an original document, an original signature on a copy of a document, and a copy of a document with an original signature on it are all valid signatures, unless specifically noted in this chapter. If a copy of the tax return is used, the filer (or at least one of the filers of a joint return) must sign it or the tax preparer must provide their name and SSN, EIN, or PTIN. Suggested Verification Text The Department has developed suggested text that you may use to create a verification document and to verify non-tax items, such as family size. To review the suggested text for 2025-26, please see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10. The suggested text fulfills verification requirements, but schools do not have to use it, except as noted below. Instead, they may develop and use their own (or someone else9s) text, forms, documents, statements, and certifications that are specific to the items required to be verified for a particular student or group of students at the school. However, schools they tried to locate their estranged spouse. The school determines that the student doesn9t need to verify their spouse9s tax and income information. However, the student must still verify their own information. The school may also choose to use professional judgment to remove the spouse9s information from the student9s FAFSA form.']","The FAFSA Simplification Act impacts the calculation of student aid for periods shorter than nine months by eliminating the provision that allowed schools to use alternate expected family contributions (EFCs).
