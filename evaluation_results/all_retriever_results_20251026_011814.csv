What are the conditions under which a dependent undergraduate student can receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan if their parents refuse to file a FAFSA form?,"['First Year\n$9,500\n$3,500\nSecond Year\n$10,500\n$4,500\nThird Year and Beyond\n$12,500\n$5,500\nCriteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Funds\nDependent students whose parents are unable to borrow Direct PLUS Loans due to adverse credit or other exceptional\ncircumstances may receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds up to the same amount that is available to\nindependent undergraduate students. Because Direct PLUS Loans can be made for up to the full COA minus other financial\nassistance received, the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount may not be sufficient to substitute entirely for the\namount a parent could receive under the Direct PLUS Loan program. Therefore, you should determine whether the\nparents may be able to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser who does not have an adverse credit history\nbefore originating additional unsubsidized loan amounts for the dependent student. Before a dependent student can\nreceive the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount, you must document the basis of the student9s eligibility. Some\nbasic guidelines for making this determination are discussed below. However, keep in mind that none of the following, by\nthemselves, are sufficient to make a dependent student eligible for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds:\nThe parent9s unwillingness to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan (even though the parent would otherwise be eligible to\nborrow);\nThe school9s decision not to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan program; or\nThe financial aid administrator9s belief that the parent should not borrow a Direct PLUS Loan.\nGeneral Guidelines for Determining That a Dependent Student May Receive Additional Unsubsidized Funds\nThe sections that follow provide general guidelines for making a determination that a dependent student is eligible to\nreceive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds under various circumstances.\nOnly One Parent Has Applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and Been Denied\nIf only one of a student9s parents has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and been denied based on adverse credit, you may\naward additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds on that basis, without first determining whether there is another parent\nwho could take out a Direct PLUS Loan. However, if both parents apply independently and one is approved and the other\ndenied, the dependent student is not eligible for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts.\nA Previously Approved Parent Later Requests Additional Direct PLUS Loan Funds and Is Denied\nThe dependent student may become eligible at any time during an academic year if a parent has first been approved and\nthen later denied a Direct PLUS Loan. For example, if a parent was approved for and received the full amount of a Direct\nPLUS Loan for a fall-spring loan period, but the parent is subsequently determined ineligible due to having an adverse\ncredit history when they request additional Direct PLUS Loan funds later during the spring semester, you may award\nIncreased Direct Unsubsidized Loan Eligibility for Independent Undergraduates and Certain\nDependent Undergraduates\n34 CFR 685.203(c)', 'information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form\nIf you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information\nsections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the\nstudent, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up\nto the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent\nsecond-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume\nfor information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of\nthe other Title IV programs.\nSelf-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or\nhave refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated\nstatement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students\nwithout parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide.\nDirect PLUS Loans\nDirect PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate\nstudents.\nA parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who\nmeets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a\nstudent. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is\nineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent\nwho had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements\noutlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal\ngovernment holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s\nineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student\nis otherwise eligible.\nRequirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers\nSchools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan\nProgram and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available\nto both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students. For more information, see the\ndiscussion under <Direct PLUS Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDefinition of <Parent= for Direct PLUS Loan Purposes\nIf they meet all other Direct PLUS Loan eligibility requirements, the following individuals can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on\nbehalf of a dependent undergraduate student:\nThe student9s biological parent;\nThe student9s legal adoptive parent; or\nThe student9s stepparent (spouse of the student9s biological or legal adoptive parent at the time of application), but\nonly if the stepparent is required to provide their information on the FAFSA form in accordance with the instructions\non the FAFSA form.\nGrandparents and other family members are not eligible to take out Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent\nundergraduate student unless they have legally adopted the student.\nIn addition to the parent(s) whose resources are reported on a student9s FAFSA form, any otherwise eligible biological or\nlegal adoptive parent of the dependent undergraduate student can also take out a Direct PLUS Loan on the student9s\nbehalf, even if that parent9s information is not reported on the FAFSA form.\nNote also that more than one parent can take out a Direct PLUS Loan on behalf of the same dependent undergraduate', 'Chapter 1\nStudent and Parent Eligibility for Direct Loans\nOverview\nTo be eligible for Direct Loans, a student must be enrolled on at least a half-time basis at a school that participates in the\nDirect Loan Program, and students and parents must meet the general federal student aid eligibility requirements\ncovered in Volume 1 of the Federal Student Aid Handbook. This chapter discusses other eligibility requirements that are\nspecific to the Direct Loan Program.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\nOnly students who have financial need may receive Direct Subsidized Loans. The federal government does not charge\ninterest on Direct Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled on at least a half-time basis, during the grace and\ndeferment periods, and during certain other periods (for example, during certain periods of repayment under certain\nrepayment plans that determine the required monthly payment amount based on the borrower9s income and family size).\nIf a student has received a determination of need for a Direct Subsidized Loan in an amount of $200 or less, a school may\nchoose not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and may instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan.\nFinancial need is not an eligibility requirement to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. The federal government generally\ncharges interest on Direct Unsubsidized Loans during all periods, with limited exceptions (for example, during periods of\ndeferment for cancer treatment).\nTo be eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, an undergraduate student attending a\nschool that participates in the Federal Pell Grant Program must first have received a determination of their Pell Grant\neligibility for the period of enrollment for which the student is requesting a loan.\nNo Minimum Age To Receive a Direct Loan\nStudents who are minors may receive Direct Loans, but they may not refuse to repay the loans based on a <defense of\ninfancy= (that is, by claiming that they were too young to enter into the contract of signing the promissory note).\nRequirement To Offer Both Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans\nDirect Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are two components of a single loan program. A school may not choose\nto make only Direct Subsidized Loans or only Direct Unsubsidized Loans available to its eligible students.

However, there are higher Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual\nloan limits for independent undergraduate students and for dependent undergraduates whose parents are unable to\nobtain Direct PLUS Loans. For these students, the combined Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual\nloan limits are shown below in Table 1B.\nAs with the loan limits for dependent undergraduates, the <Total (Subsidized and Unsubsidized)= limits represent the total\nof all Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans that an independent undergraduate student (or a dependent\nundergraduate whose parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan) may borrow at each level of study, for a single\nacademic year. For example, an independent, first-year undergraduate may receive up to $9,500 in Direct Subsidized\nLoans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans for a single academic year, but no more than $3,500 of this amount may be\nsubsidized. An independent first-year undergraduate who has no subsidized loan eligibility may receive up to the full\n$9,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds.\nAlthough a dependent undergraduate whose parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan has access to the same higher\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan annual loan limits as an independent undergraduate at the same grade level, the student is still\nconsidered to be a dependent student for all other Title IV purposes.\nFor more detail on the conditions under which a dependent undergraduate can receive increased Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan amounts, see <Criteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Funds= below.\nVolume 8, Chapter 4, Table 1B: Independent Undergraduate Annual Limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct\nUnsubsidized Loans\nIndependent Undergraduates (and Dependent Undergraduates\nWhose Parents Can9t Get Direct PLUS Loans)\nTotal (Subsidized and\nUnsubsidized)\nMaximum\nSubsidized', 'dependent student annual loan limits, the total loan amounts received would have been $13,500 in Direct\nSubsidized Loan funds and $6,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds ($19,500 combined subsidized and\nunsubsidized total).\nBecause the combined subsidized and unsubsidized loan amount of $32,500 that the student received for years\none through three exceeds the $31,000 dependent undergraduate aggregate loan limit, it might appear that the\nstudent would have no remaining loan eligibility for the fourth year of the program. However, only the $19,500 in\ncombined subsidized and unsubsidized loan funds that the student could have received under the dependent\nstudent annual loan limits are counted against the $31,000 aggregate, leaving the student with $11,500 in\nremaining loan eligibility under the dependent undergraduate aggregate loan limit, not more than $9,500 of\nwhich may be subsidized. Therefore, in the fourth year of the program (when the student9s parent is eligible to\nreceive a Direct PLUS Loan), the student could receive up to the full combined subsidized and unsubsidized\nannual loan limit for a dependent fourth-year undergraduate (that is, $7,500, not more than $5,500 of which may\nbe subsidized).']","['information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.

If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan Program and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available to both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students.

For more information, see the discussion under <Direct PLUS Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.']","A dependent undergraduate student can receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan if their parents refuse to file a FAFSA form under specific conditions. According to the provided context, if it is verified that the parents have either refused to complete the parental information sections of the FAFSA or have ended financial support for the student, a financial aid administrator may exercise professional judgment to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. 

The amount that can be awarded is up to the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For example, a second-year dependent undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds under these circumstances. However, it is important to note that the student would not be eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans or any other Title IV programs in this situation.

To substantiate the claim that the parents have refused to file the FAFSA or have ended financial support, a signed and dated statement from one of the student's parents is typically required, as self-certification from the student alone is not sufficient. 

In summary, the conditions for a dependent undergraduate student to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan when their parents refuse to file a FAFSA include:
1. Verification of the parents' refusal to complete the FAFSA or their cessation of financial support.
2. Documentation, such as a signed statement from a parent.
3.

Who can get Direct PLUS Loan for student?,"['student. For example, if a student9s biological or legal adoptive parents are divorced, they may decide to each take out a\nDirect PLUS Loan for an agreed upon amount (not to exceed the student9s COA, minus other financial assistance (OFA)) to\nhelp pay for the cost of the student9s education.\nRequirement for Dependent Students To File a FAFSA Form\nIn all cases, the dependent student on whose behalf a parent has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan must have filed a FAFSA\nform and received an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or FAFSA Submission Summary (see Chapter 1 of the\nApplication and Verification Guide for information on the ISIR and FAFSA Submission Summary). This requirement ensures\nthat student eligibility data matches are conducted to verify that the dependent student on whose behalf the parent is\nborrowing:\nIs not in default on a Title IV loan and does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant;\nHas had their Social Security number verified by the Social Security Administration; and\nHas had their citizenship status confirmed by either the Social Security Administration or the Department of\nHomeland Security.\nNote that this requirement is for the student to submit a FAFSA form. It is not a requirement for the parent borrower to\nsubmit a FAFSA form in the parent9s name, and it does not preclude an otherwise eligible parent whose information is not\nincluded on the FAFSA form (sometimes referred to as a <non-custodial= parent) from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan.\nBefore originating a Direct PLUS Loan for a parent borrower, schools must review the ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary\nof the dependent student to ensure there are no student eligibility issues that must be resolved before the parent can\nreceive the Direct PLUS Loan.\nAdverse Credit History\nAn individual with an adverse credit history is prohibited from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan unless they meet additional\neligibility requirements. The Department obtains a credit report on each student or parent applicant for a Direct PLUS\nLoan. An applicant is considered to have an adverse credit history if:\nThey have one or more debts with a total combined outstanding balance greater than $2,085 that (1) are 90 or more\ndays delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or (2) have been placed in collection or charged-off during the two\nyears preceding the date of the credit report; or\nDuring the five years preceding the date of the credit report, the applicant has been determined to be in default on a\ndebt; has had debts discharged in bankruptcy; or has been the subject of foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage\ngarnishment, or write-off of a Title IV debt.\nFor Direct PLUS Loan eligibility purposes, <charged-off= means a debt that has been written off as a loss, but that is still\nsubject to collection action. <In collection= means a debt that has been placed with a collection agency by a creditor or\nthat is subject to more intensive efforts by a creditor to recover amounts owed from a borrower who has not responded\nsatisfactorily to the routine demands of the creditor9s billing procedures.\nAn applicant cannot be denied a Direct PLUS Loan because they have no credit history. That is, the absence of a credit\nhistory is not considered to be adverse credit.\nThere are two means by which a Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit history can still qualify for a Direct\nPLUS Loan. One option is for the applicant to obtain an endorser who doesn9t have an adverse credit history. An endorser\nis someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower doesn9t repay it. For a parent borrower, the\nendorser may not be the dependent student for whom the parent is borrowing.\nAs an alternative to obtaining an endorser, an applicant who has been determined to have an adverse credit history may\nalso qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan by submitting documentation to the Department showing that there are extenuating\ncircumstances associated with the adverse credit. The Department has the final decision on determining whether\nextenuating circumstances exist.\nA borrower who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting to the satisfaction of the\nDepartment that extenuating circumstances exist must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling, as discussed below.', 'information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form\nIf you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information\nsections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the\nstudent, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up\nto the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent\nsecond-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume\nfor information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of\nthe other Title IV programs.\nSelf-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or\nhave refused to complete the FAFSA form.

Note, however, that a parent9s\nineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student\nis otherwise eligible.\nRequirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers\nSchools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan\nProgram and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available\nto both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students.

A Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified through the\nDepartment9s National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as being in default on a Title IV loan and who has also been\ndetermined to have an adverse credit history (due to the default and/or other adverse credit conditions) cannot qualify for\na Direct PLUS Loan simply by obtaining an endorser or by providing acceptable documentation of extenuating\ncircumstances. The applicant must also separately resolve the default status by one of the means discussed under\n<Resolving Default Status= in Volume 1, Chapter 3.\nIn some cases, the Direct PLUS Loan credit check may not reveal a default on a Title IV loan, particularly if the default is\nnot recent. If a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified in NSLDS as being in default on a Title IV\nloan does not have any other adverse credit issues, the applicant will pass the PLUS credit check. In this circumstance you\ncannot assume that the approved credit check result supersedes the information in NSLDS. The default must be resolved\nbefore you can disburse Direct PLUS Loan funds or other Title IV aid to the applicant.\nDirect PLUS Loan Application\nSchools that offer Direct PLUS Loans have the option of requiring student and parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants to\ncomplete the Direct PLUS Loan Application (formally known as the ""Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request for Supplemental\nInformation"") on the Department\'s StudentAid.gov website as the first step in applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. The Direct\nPLUS Loan Application collects the requested loan amount, the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended, and\nother information related to processing the requested Direct PLUS Loan.\nUse of the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov is not required. Schools may choose to develop their own\nprocesses for obtaining the information needed to originate Direct PLUS Loans.\nAlthough the Department9s FAFSA Processing System (FPS) matches student Direct PLUS Loan applicants against NSLDS\nto determine if they are in default on a Title IV loan, it does not perform this match for parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants.\nHowever, the Department conducts an NSLDS default check on all Direct PLUS Loan applicants (both students and\nparents) who complete the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov.\nSchools that use the Direct PLUS Loan Application are notified of the result of the NSLDS default check through the\nCommon Origination and Disbursement (COD) System. The result is reported as one of the following values:\n""N"" = The borrower is not in default on any Title IV loan.\nDefinition of <Adverse Credit History=\n34 CFR 685.200(c)(2)(viii)(B)\n34 CFR 685.200(b)(5)', 'additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the student. However, the Direct PLUS Loan funds that the parent previously\nreceived during the same period of enrollment must be treated as OFA when determining the additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan amount that the student is eligible to receive.\nA Parent Is Unable To Borrow a Direct PLUS Loan For Reasons Other Than Adverse Credit History (Exceptional\nCircumstances)\nIn addition to cases in which a parent has been denied a Direct PLUS Loan due to adverse credit, a dependent\nundergraduate student may also be eligible for increased unsubsidized loan amounts if you determine and document the\nexistence of exceptional circumstances other than adverse credit that would prevent a parent from borrowing a Direct\nPLUS Loan.\nIf you make such a determination, you may award increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts to a dependent\nundergraduate even if the student9s parent previously applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and was found to not have an\nadverse credit history. Similarly, if you make such a determination before a parent has requested a Direct PLUS Loan, you\nmay award the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student without requiring the parent to apply\nfor a Direct PLUS Loan.\nExamples of such exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited, to the following:\nThe parent is incarcerated.\nThe parent9s whereabouts are unknown.\nThe parent has filed for bankruptcy and has provided a letter from the bankruptcy court stating that as a condition of\nthe bankruptcy filing, the parent may not incur any additional debt.\nThe parent9s income is limited to public assistance or disability benefits, and you have documented that the parent\nwould not be able to repay the Direct PLUS Loan.\nYou have examined the family financial information and documented the parent9s likely inability to repay the Direct\nPLUS Loan due to an existing debt burden or the parent9s expected income-to-debt ratio.\nThe parent of a dependent student is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, is not a qualified alien, or is not able\nto provide evidence from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that they are in the United States for other\nthan a temporary purpose with the intention of becoming a citizen or permanent resident.\nBefore originating a loan for the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts based on a parent9s ineligibility for a Direct\nPLUS Loan due to adverse credit or other exceptional circumstances, you must document the basis of the dependent\nstudent9s eligibility.\nA determination that a parent is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan in one academic year based on adverse credit or other\nexceptional circumstances does not automatically support the dependent student9s additional unsubsidized loan eligibility\nin subsequent years. If a dependent student is determined to be eligible for additional unsubsidized loan amounts in one\nacademic year, you must re-examine and document that the basis for the student9s eligibility continues to exist before\noriginating additional unsubsidized loan amounts for the student in a subsequent year.\nAnnual Loan Limit for Graduate and Professional Students\nThe annual loan limit for graduate or professional students is shown below in Table 1C. Graduate and professional\nstudents are not eligible to receive Direct Subsidized Loans, so the annual loan limit for these students represents only\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans.\nA student in an undergraduate program is not eligible for the graduate loan limit based on taking graduate coursework as\na part of the undergraduate program. In contrast, a graduate student taking some undergraduate coursework is eligible\nfor the graduate loan limit if the student is enrolled at least half time in courses (graduate or undergraduate) that can be\napplied to the graduate program. However, the student must already be admitted into the graduate program.\nA student with a bachelor9s degree who is taking preparatory work for graduate school (or whose full admission to the\ngraduate program is contingent upon completion of certain undergraduate courses) is not eligible for graduate loan limits.\nSee the discussion later in this chapter on annual loan limits for students taking preparatory coursework.', 'First Year\n$9,500\n$3,500\nSecond Year\n$10,500\n$4,500\nThird Year and Beyond\n$12,500\n$5,500\nCriteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Funds\nDependent students whose parents are unable to borrow Direct PLUS Loans due to adverse credit or other exceptional\ncircumstances may receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds up to the same amount that is available to\nindependent undergraduate students. Because Direct PLUS Loans can be made for up to the full COA minus other financial\nassistance received, the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount may not be sufficient to substitute entirely for the\namount a parent could receive under the Direct PLUS Loan program. Therefore, you should determine whether the\nparents may be able to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser who does not have an adverse credit history\nbefore originating additional unsubsidized loan amounts for the dependent student. Before a dependent student can\nreceive the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount, you must document the basis of the student9s eligibility. Some\nbasic guidelines for making this determination are discussed below. However, keep in mind that none of the following, by\nthemselves, are sufficient to make a dependent student eligible for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds:\nThe parent9s unwillingness to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan (even though the parent would otherwise be eligible to\nborrow);\nThe school9s decision not to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan program; or\nThe financial aid administrator9s belief that the parent should not borrow a Direct PLUS Loan.\nGeneral Guidelines for Determining That a Dependent Student May Receive Additional Unsubsidized Funds\nThe sections that follow provide general guidelines for making a determination that a dependent student is eligible to\nreceive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds under various circumstances.\nOnly One Parent Has Applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and Been Denied\nIf only one of a student9s parents has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and been denied based on adverse credit, you may\naward additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds on that basis, without first determining whether there is another parent\nwho could take out a Direct PLUS Loan. However, if both parents apply independently and one is approved and the other\ndenied, the dependent student is not eligible for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts.\nA Previously Approved Parent Later Requests Additional Direct PLUS Loan Funds and Is Denied\nThe dependent student may become eligible at any time during an academic year if a parent has first been approved and\nthen later denied a Direct PLUS Loan. For example, if a parent was approved for and received the full amount of a Direct\nPLUS Loan for a fall-spring loan period, but the parent is subsequently determined ineligible due to having an adverse\ncredit history when they request additional Direct PLUS Loan funds later during the spring semester, you may award\nIncreased Direct Unsubsidized Loan Eligibility for Independent Undergraduates and Certain\nDependent Undergraduates\n34 CFR 685.203(c)']","['Definition of <Parent= for Direct PLUS Loan Purposes If they meet all other Direct PLUS Loan eligibility requirements, the following individuals can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent undergraduate student: The student9s biological parent; The student9s legal adoptive parent; or The student9s stepparent (spouse of the student9s biological or legal adoptive parent at the time of application), but only if the stepparent is required to provide their information on the FAFSA form in accordance with the instructions on the FAFSA form. Grandparents and other family members are not eligible to take out Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent undergraduate student unless they have legally adopted the student. In addition to the parent(s) whose resources are reported on a student9s FAFSA form, any otherwise eligible biological or legal adoptive parent of the dependent undergraduate student can also take out a Direct PLUS Loan on the student9s behalf, even if that parent9s information is not reported on the FAFSA form. Note also that more than one parent can take out a Direct PLUS Loan on behalf of the same dependent undergraduate']","Direct PLUS Loans are available to two main groups: graduate and professional students, and the parents of dependent undergraduate students. 

1. **Graduate and Professional Students**: These students can apply for Direct PLUS Loans to help cover their educational costs.

2. **Parents of Dependent Undergraduate Students**: A parent can obtain a Direct PLUS Loan to pay for the education costs of their dependent undergraduate child. The eligible parent can be:
   - The biological parent of the student.
   - The legal adoptive parent of the student.
   - The stepparent, provided they are required to provide their information on the FAFSA form.

It's important to note that grandparents and other family members cannot take out Direct PLUS Loans unless they have legally adopted the student. Additionally, both groups must meet certain eligibility requirements, including citizenship and residency criteria, and must not be in default on a Title IV loan or owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to resolve these issues.

"What are the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers, including those with adverse credit history, and what responsibilities do schools have in this process?","['Chapter 2\nDirect Loan Counseling\nCounseling Overview\nFirst-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a\nDirect Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled\non at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'Regardless of the counseling methods your school uses, it must document that the student received entrance and exit\ncounseling, and it must ensure that an individual with expertise in the Title IV programs is reasonably available shortly\nafter the counseling to answer the student9s questions.\nCounseling for Correspondence and Study Abroad Students\nIf a first-time student borrower has enrolled in a study-abroad program (approved by a U.S. school for credit) or a\ncorrespondence or distance learning program, the school must document that the student has completed online entrance\ncounseling that meets the regulatory Direct Loan entrance counseling requirements or provide written entrance\ncounseling information by mail or email before making the first disbursement of a Direct Loan to the student.\nIn the case of exit counseling for correspondence programs or study abroad programs, the school may mail or email the\nborrower written counseling materials within 30 days after the borrower completes the program, with a request that they\nprovide the contact and personal information that would ordinarily have been collected through the counseling process.\nProviding Additional Information\nYour school can take additional steps to counsel students, such as assisting them with developing a budget, estimating\nneed for loans, and planning for repayment. You can also reinforce messages to borrowers. For example, with each\ndisbursement you can remind students about the importance of maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP; see\nVolume 1, Chapter 1 for details on SAP requirements), planning for future employment, and staying in touch with the loan\nservicer. Sample measures for loan counseling are given in the <Sample Default Prevention Plan= that can be found in the\nregulations cited below.\nPLUS Loan Credit Counseling\nSpecial loan counseling is required for any student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has been determined to\nhave an adverse credit history, but who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan either by getting a loan endorser or by\ndocumenting to the satisfaction of the Department that there are extenuating circumstances related to the adverse\ncredit. While the special PLUS Loan Credit Counseling is mandatory only for these borrowers, any PLUS borrower can\nvoluntarily complete this counseling. See Chapter 1 of this volume for more information about adverse credit.\nNote that the special counseling described above is separate from the entrance counseling that all first-time graduate and\nprofessional student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers must complete, as described earlier in this chapter.\nAnnual Student Loan Acknowledgement\nThe Department offers a tool on the StudentAid.gov website called the Annual Student Loan Acknowledgement.

In this circumstance you\ncannot assume that the approved credit check result supersedes the information in NSLDS. The default must be resolved\nbefore you can disburse Direct PLUS Loan funds or other Title IV aid to the applicant.\nDirect PLUS Loan Application\nSchools that offer Direct PLUS Loans have the option of requiring student and parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants to\ncomplete the Direct PLUS Loan Application (formally known as the ""Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request for Supplemental\nInformation"") on the Department\'s StudentAid.gov website as the first step in applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. The Direct\nPLUS Loan Application collects the requested loan amount, the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended, and\nother information related to processing the requested Direct PLUS Loan.\nUse of the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov is not required.

There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers who meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit history. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school responsibilities.']","Direct Loan borrowers, including those with adverse credit history, have specific counseling requirements that schools must adhere to. Here’s a comprehensive overview:

### Counseling Requirements for Direct Loan Borrowers

1. **Entrance Counseling**:
   - **Who Must Complete**: All first-time student borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and student Direct PLUS Loans must complete entrance counseling before their first disbursement. Parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers are exempt from this requirement.
   - **Content Covered**: The counseling must explain:
     - The use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN).
     - The importance of the loan repayment obligation.
     - Consequences of default, including adverse credit reports and collection procedures.
     - The borrower's obligation to repay the loan regardless of program completion or employment status.
     - Sample monthly repayment amounts based on different levels of indebtedness.
     - How accepting the loan affects eligibility for other financial aid.
     - Interest accrual and capitalization.
     - The definition of half-time enrollment and its consequences.
     - Importance of contacting the school if withdrawing from the program.

2. **Exit Counseling**:
   - All Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled at least half-time. This counseling provides information about repayment obligations and options.

3. **Special Counseling for Adverse Credit History**:
   - Any student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit history who qualifies for a loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting extenuating circumstances must complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling. This requirement is separate from the standard entrance counseling.

### Responsibilities of Schools

- **Documentation**: Schools must document that students have completed both entrance and exit counseling.
- **Availability of Expertise**: An individual with expertise in Title IV programs must be reasonably available to answer students' questions shortly after counseling sessions.
- **Counseling Methods**: Schools can conduct counseling through various methods, including in-person sessions, online platforms, or written materials. If conducted online, schools must ensure students complete the counseling, which may include a test to assess understanding.
- **Additional Support**: Schools can provide additional resources, such as budgeting assistance and financial literacy classes, but cannot require these as a condition for receiving Direct Loans.

### Conclusion

In summary, Direct Loan borrowers must undergo both entrance and exit counseling, with additional requirements for those with adverse credit histories. Schools play a crucial role in facilitating this process, ensuring compliance with regulations, and providing necessary support to borrowers.","First-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a Direct Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers who meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit history.

"How do exceptions to the normal loan period apply to Direct PLUS Loans when clinical work is involved, and what are the implications if a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passes away?","['may not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of\npayments while the student was enrolled at least half time.\nIf a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death,\nthe school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of\nthe original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent\nstudent (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4\nof this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate\na Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended.\nFor additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the\nFSA Handbook.\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term\nVolume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and\nnonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine\nweeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education\nprogram work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical\nWork in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below.\nIf clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard\nterm, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.\nIf a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the\nstarting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of\nthe clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on\nAugust 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not\nbegin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be\nthe beginning date of the term.\nIf the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a\nDirect Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the\ncase).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the\nspring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as\nSeptember 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which\nit is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term.\nIf loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the\nnormal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies,\nand the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of\na fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that\nfall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1\nthrough June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1\nthrough June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for\ninformation on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits).\nIf there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work,\nand the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to\nbegin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two\nloan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.', ""Regardless of the length of the loan period, you may disburse a Direct Loan in a single installment if the loan is to cover a\nstudent's COA in a study abroad program and your school9s calculated cohort default rate is less than 5% for the most\nrecent fiscal year for which data are available.\nDirect Loan Disbursements for Completed Payment Periods\nThe Direct Loan Program regulations allow a school to include in a single disbursement the disbursements for any\npayment periods that have ended. However, the COD System (except for schools exempted because of low default rates)\nrequires schools to enter at least two anticipated disbursement dates. Therefore, when creating a loan origination record\nfor a Direct Loan when you intend to include in a disbursement loan proceeds for any payment periods that have been\ncompleted, you should enter the actual date you anticipate making the disbursement as the anticipated date for all\ndisbursements that would be included. For example, consider a school attempting to submit an origination when the data\nis as follows:\nLoan period: 09/01 - 05/30 (fall through spring)\nMinimum number of disbursements normally required: 2\nPayment period 1: 09/01 - 12/20\nPayment period 2: 01/06 - 05/30\nDate school creates origination record: 01/09\nIf you anticipate disbursing the loan proceeds for both payment periods on January 16, you should enter January 16 as the\ndate for both the first and second disbursements when you create the origination record.\nDirect Loan Disbursements Made After the Date of the Borrower9s Death\nIf a school learns that a student or parent Direct Loan borrower has died before one or more disbursements of a loan have\nbeen made, the school must cancel all pending disbursements. Direct Loan funds cannot be disbursed when there is no\npossibility of repayment. In addition, if a school is not informed of a student or parent borrower9s death until after one or\nmore loan disbursements have been made, the school must return to the Department the full amount of all loan funds\nthat were credited to the student9s school account after the date of the borrower9s death (if the post-death disbursement\ncreated a credit balance that was paid directly to the student or parent, the school is not responsible for returning the\ncredit balance amount).\nDisbursements after the date of the borrower9s death are most likely to occur when a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower\ndies. If an enrolled student dies, the school will generally learn of the death in a timely manner and can cancel any\npending loan disbursements. However, if a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower dies, the student or other family members\nStudy Abroad Program Exception\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(6)(i)(B)\nDirect Loan Disbursement After One or More Payment Periods Have Elapsed\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(4)(i)"", 'student. For example, if a student9s biological or legal adoptive parents are divorced, they may decide to each take out a\nDirect PLUS Loan for an agreed upon amount (not to exceed the student9s COA, minus other financial assistance (OFA)) to\nhelp pay for the cost of the student9s education.\nRequirement for Dependent Students To File a FAFSA Form\nIn all cases, the dependent student on whose behalf a parent has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan must have filed a FAFSA\nform and received an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or FAFSA Submission Summary (see Chapter 1 of the\nApplication and Verification Guide for information on the ISIR and FAFSA Submission Summary). This requirement ensures\nthat student eligibility data matches are conducted to verify that the dependent student on whose behalf the parent is\nborrowing:\nIs not in default on a Title IV loan and does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant;\nHas had their Social Security number verified by the Social Security Administration; and\nHas had their citizenship status confirmed by either the Social Security Administration or the Department of\nHomeland Security.\nNote that this requirement is for the student to submit a FAFSA form. It is not a requirement for the parent borrower to\nsubmit a FAFSA form in the parent9s name, and it does not preclude an otherwise eligible parent whose information is not\nincluded on the FAFSA form (sometimes referred to as a <non-custodial= parent) from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan.\nBefore originating a Direct PLUS Loan for a parent borrower, schools must review the ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary\nof the dependent student to ensure there are no student eligibility issues that must be resolved before the parent can\nreceive the Direct PLUS Loan.\nAdverse Credit History\nAn individual with an adverse credit history is prohibited from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan unless they meet additional\neligibility requirements. The Department obtains a credit report on each student or parent applicant for a Direct PLUS\nLoan. An applicant is considered to have an adverse credit history if:\nThey have one or more debts with a total combined outstanding balance greater than $2,085 that (1) are 90 or more\ndays delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or (2) have been placed in collection or charged-off during the two\nyears preceding the date of the credit report; or\nDuring the five years preceding the date of the credit report, the applicant has been determined to be in default on a\ndebt; has had debts discharged in bankruptcy; or has been the subject of foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage\ngarnishment, or write-off of a Title IV debt.\nFor Direct PLUS Loan eligibility purposes, <charged-off= means a debt that has been written off as a loss, but that is still\nsubject to collection action. <In collection= means a debt that has been placed with a collection agency by a creditor or\nthat is subject to more intensive efforts by a creditor to recover amounts owed from a borrower who has not responded\nsatisfactorily to the routine demands of the creditor9s billing procedures.\nAn applicant cannot be denied a Direct PLUS Loan because they have no credit history. That is, the absence of a credit\nhistory is not considered to be adverse credit.\nThere are two means by which a Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit history can still qualify for a Direct\nPLUS Loan. One option is for the applicant to obtain an endorser who doesn9t have an adverse credit history. An endorser\nis someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower doesn9t repay it. For a parent borrower, the\nendorser may not be the dependent student for whom the parent is borrowing.\nAs an alternative to obtaining an endorser, an applicant who has been determined to have an adverse credit history may\nalso qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan by submitting documentation to the Department showing that there are extenuating\ncircumstances associated with the adverse credit. The Department has the final decision on determining whether\nextenuating circumstances exist.\nA borrower who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting to the satisfaction of the\nDepartment that extenuating circumstances exist must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling, as discussed below.', 'If your school participates in the Direct PLUS program but a student9s parent cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the\nstudent is allowed to borrow additional unsubsidized funds (see <Criteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan Funds= in Chapter 4 of this volume).\nRequired Counseling for Direct PLUS Loan Applicants With Adverse Credit\nAny student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has an adverse credit history but qualifies by obtaining an endorser\nor documenting that there are extenuating circumstances must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling on the\nDepartment9s StudentAid.gov website.\nAdverse Credit History and Default\nAlthough a default on a Title IV loan will generally appear in a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant9s credit record\nand result in the individual being determined to have an adverse credit history, being in default on a Title IV loan and\nhaving an adverse credit history are separate eligibility issues. A Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified through the\nDepartment9s National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as being in default on a Title IV loan and who has also been\ndetermined to have an adverse credit history (due to the default and/or other adverse credit conditions) cannot qualify for\na Direct PLUS Loan simply by obtaining an endorser or by providing acceptable documentation of extenuating\ncircumstances. The applicant must also separately resolve the default status by one of the means discussed under\n<Resolving Default Status= in Volume 1, Chapter 3.\nIn some cases, the Direct PLUS Loan credit check may not reveal a default on a Title IV loan, particularly if the default is\nnot recent. If a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified in NSLDS as being in default on a Title IV\nloan does not have any other adverse credit issues, the applicant will pass the PLUS credit check. In this circumstance you\ncannot assume that the approved credit check result supersedes the information in NSLDS. The default must be resolved\nbefore you can disburse Direct PLUS Loan funds or other Title IV aid to the applicant.\nDirect PLUS Loan Application\nSchools that offer Direct PLUS Loans have the option of requiring student and parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants to\ncomplete the Direct PLUS Loan Application (formally known as the ""Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request for Supplemental\nInformation"") on the Department\'s StudentAid.gov website as the first step in applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. The Direct\nPLUS Loan Application collects the requested loan amount, the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended, and\nother information related to processing the requested Direct PLUS Loan.\nUse of the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov is not required. Schools may choose to develop their own\nprocesses for obtaining the information needed to originate Direct PLUS Loans.\nAlthough the Department9s FAFSA Processing System (FPS) matches student Direct PLUS Loan applicants against NSLDS\nto determine if they are in default on a Title IV loan, it does not perform this match for parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants.\nHowever, the Department conducts an NSLDS default check on all Direct PLUS Loan applicants (both students and\nparents) who complete the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov.\nSchools that use the Direct PLUS Loan Application are notified of the result of the NSLDS default check through the\nCommon Origination and Disbursement (COD) System. The result is reported as one of the following values:\n""N"" = The borrower is not in default on any Title IV loan.\nDefinition of <Adverse Credit History=\n34 CFR 685.200(c)(2)(viii)(B)\n34 CFR 685.200(b)(5)', 'information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form\nIf you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information\nsections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the\nstudent, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up\nto the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent\nsecond-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume\nfor information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of\nthe other Title IV programs.\nSelf-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or\nhave refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated\nstatement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students\nwithout parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide.\nDirect PLUS Loans\nDirect PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate\nstudents.\nA parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who\nmeets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a\nstudent. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is\nineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent\nwho had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements\noutlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal\ngovernment holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s\nineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student\nis otherwise eligible.\nRequirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers\nSchools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan\nProgram and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available\nto both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students. For more information, see the\ndiscussion under <Direct PLUS Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDefinition of <Parent= for Direct PLUS Loan Purposes\nIf they meet all other Direct PLUS Loan eligibility requirements, the following individuals can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on\nbehalf of a dependent undergraduate student:\nThe student9s biological parent;\nThe student9s legal adoptive parent; or\nThe student9s stepparent (spouse of the student9s biological or legal adoptive parent at the time of application), but\nonly if the stepparent is required to provide their information on the FAFSA form in accordance with the instructions\non the FAFSA form.\nGrandparents and other family members are not eligible to take out Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent\nundergraduate student unless they have legally adopted the student.\nIn addition to the parent(s) whose resources are reported on a student9s FAFSA form, any otherwise eligible biological or\nlegal adoptive parent of the dependent undergraduate student can also take out a Direct PLUS Loan on the student9s\nbehalf, even if that parent9s information is not reported on the FAFSA form.\nNote also that more than one parent can take out a Direct PLUS Loan on behalf of the same dependent undergraduate']","['<1-hop>\n\nmay not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of payments while the student was enrolled at least half time. If a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death, the school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent student (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4 of this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.', '<2-hop>\n\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and nonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","Exceptions to the normal loan period for Direct PLUS Loans apply when clinical work is involved in a student's program. If clinical work meets specific criteria to be included in a standard term or substantially equal nonstandard term (at least nine weeks long), the school must adjust the loan period dates accordingly. For instance, if clinical work begins before the term starts, the loan period start date is set to the beginning of the clinical work. Conversely, if the clinical work ends after the term's official end date, the loan period end date is adjusted to the end of the clinical work.

For example, if a fall semester runs from September 1 to December 31, but clinical work starts on August 15, the loan period would be reported as August 15 to December 31. Similarly, if the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the loan period would be reported as September 1 to June 20.

Regarding the implications of a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passing away, if a school learns of the death before any disbursements are made, all pending disbursements must be canceled. If disbursements have already been made after the date of the borrower's death, the school must return those funds to the Department of Education. However, if the school is required to return funds disbursed after the borrower's death, they may consider whether a surviving parent can take out a new Direct PLUS Loan for the amount that must be returned. If this is not possible, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended. 

In summary, clinical work can lead to exceptions in loan periods for Direct PLUS Loans, and the death of a parent borrower has specific implications for disbursements and potential loan options for surviving family members.","Exceptions to the normal loan period apply to Direct PLUS Loans when clinical work is involved by allowing the loan period start date to be the beginning date of the clinical work if it starts before the term, and the loan period end date to be the ending date of the clinical work if it ends after the term. This adjustment ensures that the loan period accurately reflects the duration of the clinical work. In the event that a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passes away, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended. This ensures that the student can continue to receive financial aid despite the change in circumstances.",0.6,1.0,0.87,0.9100777216571179,0.571428570612245,0.26666666666666666,8.598799228668213,naive_rag
"What are the requirements for entrance counseling for first-time Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers, and how does this relate to the overall Direct Loan counseling process?","['Chapter 2\nDirect Loan Counseling\nCounseling Overview\nFirst-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a\nDirect Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled\non at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default. Your school can also offer financial literacy classes, on a credit or non-credit basis, that include\ninformation on budgeting, debt management, anticipated earnings by profession, elements of loan counseling, etc.,\nthough eligibility for a Direct Loan cannot be contingent on completion of such a class.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrowers\nBelow we provide a summary of the information that must be covered in entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan\nand Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers. For more detailed information, refer to the regulations cited at the end of this\nsection.\nEntrance counseling for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loan borrowers must:\nExplain the use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN);\nEmphasize the importance of the loan repayment obligation;\nDescribe the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, delinquent debt collection procedures\nunder Federal law, and litigation;\nEmphasize that the borrower must repay the full amount of the loan even if the borrower does not complete the\nprogram, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain\nemployment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services\nthat the student paid for with the loan;\nInform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on a range of student levels of\nindebtedness depending on the types of loans the borrower has received, or based on the average indebtedness of\nother borrowers in the same program at the same school;\nExplain how accepting the loan will affect the borrower9s eligibility for other forms of student financial assistance;\nProvide information on how interest accrues and is capitalized during periods when the interest is not paid by either\nthe borrower or the Department;\nInform the borrower of the option to pay the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan while the borrower is in school;\nExplain the definition of half-time enrollment at the school and the consequences of not maintaining half-time\nenrollment;\nExplain the importance of contacting the appropriate offices at the school if the borrower withdraws before\nDirect Loan Entrance Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(a)\nLoan Counseling Requirements and Flexibilities\nDCL GEN-15-06', 'Regardless of the counseling methods your school uses, it must document that the student received entrance and exit\ncounseling, and it must ensure that an individual with expertise in the Title IV programs is reasonably available shortly\nafter the counseling to answer the student9s questions.\nCounseling for Correspondence and Study Abroad Students\nIf a first-time student borrower has enrolled in a study-abroad program (approved by a U.S. school for credit) or a\ncorrespondence or distance learning program, the school must document that the student has completed online entrance\ncounseling that meets the regulatory Direct Loan entrance counseling requirements or provide written entrance\ncounseling information by mail or email before making the first disbursement of a Direct Loan to the student.\nIn the case of exit counseling for correspondence programs or study abroad programs, the school may mail or email the\nborrower written counseling materials within 30 days after the borrower completes the program, with a request that they\nprovide the contact and personal information that would ordinarily have been collected through the counseling process.\nProviding Additional Information\nYour school can take additional steps to counsel students, such as assisting them with developing a budget, estimating\nneed for loans, and planning for repayment. You can also reinforce messages to borrowers. For example, with each\ndisbursement you can remind students about the importance of maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP; see\nVolume 1, Chapter 1 for details on SAP requirements), planning for future employment, and staying in touch with the loan\nservicer. Sample measures for loan counseling are given in the <Sample Default Prevention Plan= that can be found in the\nregulations cited below.\nPLUS Loan Credit Counseling\nSpecial loan counseling is required for any student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has been determined to\nhave an adverse credit history, but who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan either by getting a loan endorser or by\ndocumenting to the satisfaction of the Department that there are extenuating circumstances related to the adverse\ncredit. While the special PLUS Loan Credit Counseling is mandatory only for these borrowers, any PLUS borrower can\nvoluntarily complete this counseling. See Chapter 1 of this volume for more information about adverse credit.\nNote that the special counseling described above is separate from the entrance counseling that all first-time graduate and\nprofessional student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers must complete, as described earlier in this chapter.\nAnnual Student Loan Acknowledgement\nThe Department offers a tool on the StudentAid.gov website called the Annual Student Loan Acknowledgement.

This section of the law requires the Department to make available\nto postsecondary schools and other entities a wide variety of information about federal student assistance programs,\nincluding information to help students assess the debt burden and repayment obligations that will be incurred as a result\nof receiving Title IV loans. As noted below under <Counseling Methods,= documentation that a borrower has completed the\nDepartment9s online exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan exit counseling requirements. Schools that choose to\nconduct their own exit counseling can meet the requirement to provide borrowers with the information made available by\nthe Department in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA by providing borrowers with a copy of the Department9s\nDirect Loan Exit Counseling Guide.\nProviding Borrower Information at Separation\nSchools that conduct their own exit counseling must provide the current personal information collected from the student\n(name, address, references, etc.) to students9 loan servicers within 60 days. Students authorize their school to release\ninformation to servicers in the loan promissory note they signed. No further permission is needed.\nStudents who complete online exit counseling on the Department9s StudentAid.gov website fulfill this requirement as part\nof the counseling session; NSLDS provides the information to the loan holders.\nCounseling Methods\nThe Department offers Direct Loan Program online entrance and exit counseling for students on the StudentAid.gov\nwebsite. Your school will receive notification through the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) (see <Required Electronic\nProcesses= in Volume 2, Chapter 3 for more information) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers, and\ncompletion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If your school documents that borrowers have\ncompleted the Department9s online counseling, it has satisfied its counseling responsibility. Documentation that a\nborrower has completed the Department9s online entrance or exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan entrance or exit\ncounseling requirements.\nYour school may also choose to provide entrance or exit counseling through an in-person session or (for entrance\ncounseling) by providing a separate written form to the student that the student signs and returns to the school. If your\nschool conducts in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions\ncan help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive\nprograms to ensure that students understand the terms and conditions of their loans. Counseling materials, such as the\nentrance and exit counseling guides, are available in the Financial Aid Toolkit.\nA school may adopt an alternative approach for entrance counseling as a part of its quality assurance plan.

There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers who meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit history. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school responsibilities.', '<2-hop>\n\nEntrance Counseling Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. For this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student who requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before the authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan to a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling. Entrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are about to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person counseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.

You may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance counseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements are reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that unreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling can include one or more of the following: Extra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods; A requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though you cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan); A requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or A requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.']","For first-time Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers, entrance counseling is a mandatory requirement before they can receive their first disbursement of the loan. This counseling is also required for first-time borrowers of Direct Unsubsidized Loans and student Direct PLUS Loans, but it is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.

### Requirements for Entrance Counseling:
1. **Definition of First-Time Borrower**: A first-time borrower is defined as someone who has not previously received a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan.

2. **Content of Counseling**: The entrance counseling must cover several key topics, including:
   - The use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN).
   - The importance of the loan repayment obligation.
   - Consequences of default, including adverse credit reports and collection procedures.
   - The borrower's obligation to repay the loan regardless of their educational outcomes.
   - Sample monthly repayment amounts based on different levels of indebtedness.
   - How accepting the loan affects eligibility for other financial aid.
   - Information on interest accrual and capitalization.
   - The definition of half-time enrollment and its implications.
   - Importance of contacting the school if the borrower withdraws.

3. **Delivery Methods**: Counseling can be conducted in various formats:
   - In-person sessions.
   - Written forms that the borrower signs and returns.
   - Online or interactive electronic means, with a requirement for the borrower to acknowledge receipt of the information.

4. **Completion Verification**: Schools must ensure that students complete the counseling, which may include a test to assess understanding. Schools must also have someone available to answer questions after the counseling session.

5. **Documentation**: Schools are required to document that the student has completed the entrance counseling.

### Relation to Overall Direct Loan Counseling Process:
Entrance counseling is part of a broader Direct Loan counseling process that includes exit counseling, which is required for all Direct Loan borrowers before they cease enrollment at least half-time. While entrance counseling focuses on informing borrowers about their responsibilities and the terms of their loans, exit counseling provides information about repayment options and obligations after leaving school.

Additionally, schools can encourage borrowers to participate in further counseling beyond the required entrance counseling to enhance their understanding of borrowing and repayment, but they cannot make such additional counseling a condition for receiving loans.

In summary, entrance counseling is a critical step for first-time borrowers to ensure they are informed about their loans and responsibilities, forming an essential part of the overall Direct Loan counseling framework.","Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers. This counseling provides comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan and the borrower's responsibility to repay it. It can be conducted in-person, through written forms, or online, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. Schools must ensure that students complete the counseling, which may include a test of their understanding. This requirement is part of the broader Direct Loan counseling process, which also includes exit counseling for all student Direct Loan borrowers before they cease to be enrolled at least half-time. The overall process ensures that borrowers are informed about their loans and responsibilities, aligning with the school's responsibilities to guide students through their financial aid options.",1.0,1.0,0.57,0.9593109459850783,0.49999999916666665,,14.694995164871216,naive_rag
How do student loan eligibility criteria and minimum loan periods interact when a student is ineligible for a term within a fall-winter-spring academic year?,"['period are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be\nenrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and\nspring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be\nenrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering\nthe fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s\nCOA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a\nschool initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of\nat least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily\ndrops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not\nrequired to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school\nto adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and\nspring quarters only.\nIn the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-\nonly loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring\nloan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would\nthen be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining\nthe student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods\nOther Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a\nstudent9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs\nassociated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the\nfall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine\nmonths.\nThe limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last\nterms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period.\nFor instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall\nterm or the spring term.\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when\nperiods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\nMinimum Loan Periods\nThe minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar.\nAs explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a\nDirect Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on\nwhether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard\nor nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the\ncase of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below.\nNonstandard terms may be one of the following types:\n1. \nNonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any\nother term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length.\nSE9W\nPeriod of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition\n34 CFR 685.102(b)', '2. \nNonstandard terms that are substantially equal, but one or more of the terms in the academic year\ncontains fewer than nine weeks.\nNon-\nSE9W\n3. \nNonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length (one or more of the terms in the academic\nyear differs in length from another term by more than two weeks).\nNon-\nSE9W\nWe refer to the first type of nonstandard term as <SE9W= nonstandard terms. We group the second and third types\ntogether and refer to them as <non-SE9W= nonstandard terms.\nPrograms with SE9W nonstandard terms are treated the same as standard-term programs for purposes of determining\nminimum loan period length and monitoring annual loan limits. However, programs with non-SE9W nonstandard terms are\ntreated the same as non-term programs for these purposes.\nNote that substantially equal nonstandard terms (the first two types of nonstandard terms described above) are treated\ndifferently for purposes of determining Direct Loan payment periods than for determining minimum loan period length\nand monitoring annual loan limits. As explained in Volume 1, Chapter 1, if a program is offered in standard terms or in\nnonstandard terms that are substantially equal in length (regardless of the length of the nonstandard term), the payment\nperiod is the term.\nHowever, for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and monitoring Direct Loan annual loan\nlimits, substantially equal nonstandard terms that contain fewer than nine weeks are treated the same as nonstandard\nterms that are not substantially equal. This means that if a program has substantially equal nonstandard terms that are\nless than nine weeks in length, you must make a Direct Loan disbursement each term (the same as would be the case if\nthe program were offered in standard terms), but the minimum loan period and the type of academic year used to\nmonitor Direct Loan annual loan limits must be determined in accordance with the rules that apply to non-term programs.\nFor detailed information on standard term, nonstandard term, and non-term programs, see Volume 1, Chapter 1.\nMinimum Loan Period: Standard Term and SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\nFor credit-hour programs with standard terms (semesters, quarters, or trimesters), or with SE9W\nnonstandard terms, the minimum loan period is a single academic term. For example, if a student will be enrolled in the\nfall semester only and will skip the spring semester, you may originate a loan with a loan period that covers only the fall\nterm.\nMinimum Loan Period: Clock-Hour, Non-Term, and Non-SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\nFor all other programs (i.e., clock-hour, non-term, and non-SE9W nonstandard term programs), the minimum\nloan period is generally the lesser of the program length (or remainder of the program, if there is less than full academic\nyear remaining) or the academic year. There are exceptions to this minimum loan period rule when originating loans for\ntransfer students, or for students who complete or otherwise cease enrollment in one program and then begin a different\nprogram at the same school. We discuss these exceptions in detail in Chapter 7 of this volume.\nMinimum Loan Period: Programs Offered in Modules\nIf a program is offered in modules, this does not change the minimum loan period rules for Direct Loans.

However, if your school\napplies the annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans to a period of time greater than\nan academic year, you may originate a Direct Loan for that longer period of time. For example, a school might offer an\n1100 clock-hour program and define the academic year as 900 clock hours but could choose to allow students to receive\njust one annual loan limit for the entire 1100-hour program.

For example, if a student is expected to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and spring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be enrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering the fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s COA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a school initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of at least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily drops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not required to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school to adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and spring quarters only. In the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring- only loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring loan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would then be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining the student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods Other Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a student9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs associated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the fall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months. The limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last terms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period. For instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall term or the spring term. Note: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when periods of clinical work are included in a standard term.', '<2-hop>\n\nMinimum Loan Periods The minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar. As explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on whether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard or nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the case of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below. Nonstandard terms may be one of the following types: 1. Nonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any other term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length. SE9W Period of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition 34 CFR 685.102(b)']","When a student is ineligible for a term within a fall-winter-spring academic year, the interaction between student loan eligibility criteria and minimum loan periods can be complex. Here are the key points based on the provided context:

1. **Loan Period Definition**: A school may originate a loan for a loan period that covers multiple terms (e.g., fall, winter, and spring) even if the student is ineligible for one of those terms, as long as the ineligible term is not the first or last term in the loan period. For example, if a student plans to attend the fall and spring quarters but not the winter quarter, the school can still originate a loan for the entire fall-winter-spring period.

2. **Cost of Attendance (COA)**: When determining the loan amount, the school must exclude any costs associated with the ineligible term from the COA. This means that if a student is not attending the winter quarter, the costs for that quarter cannot be included when calculating the loan amount for the fall and spring quarters.

3. **Adjustments to Loan Amounts**: If a student initially qualifies for a loan covering all three quarters but later becomes ineligible for the winter quarter (e.g., by dropping below half-time status), the school is not required to change the loan period. However, it may need to adjust the loan amount based on the reduced costs for the fall and spring quarters only.

4. **Separate Loans Option**: The school has the option to originate separate loans for the fall and spring quarters instead of a single loan covering all three quarters. If this route is taken, the school must subtract the student's full SAI (Student Aid Index) from the costs for each term when determining eligibility for Direct Subsidized Loans.

5. **Proration of Loan Limits**: If the remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year due to the ineligibility for a term, the annual loan limit may need to be prorated based on the number of hours the student is expected to attend in the eligible terms compared to the total hours in the academic year.

In summary, while a student can still receive a loan for a fall-winter-spring period despite being ineligible for the winter term, the school must carefully adjust the COA and loan amounts accordingly, and it has the option to create separate loans for the eligible terms.","Student loan eligibility criteria allow a school to originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring period even if a student is ineligible for one of the terms, such as the winter quarter, provided the student is eligible during the first and last terms of the loan period. However, no costs associated with the ineligible term can be included in the student's Cost of Attendance (COA) when determining the loan amount. The minimum loan period for originating a Direct Loan depends on the school's academic calendar and whether the program is term-based or non-term. For term-based programs with nonstandard terms, the terms must be substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length. This interaction ensures that while students can receive loans for eligible terms, the loan amounts must be adjusted to reflect only the periods of eligibility, adhering to the minimum loan period requirements.",1.0,0.9375,0.6,0.9630862423491315,0.29999999969999996,0.1875,7.465867042541504,naive_rag
"How does proration apply to students in clock-hour programs when their remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year, and what are some examples of this proration process?","['Graduate Early From a Clock-Hour Program= later in this chapter).\nIn a standard-term program, or a credit-hour program using SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of\nstudy is considered shorter than an academic year if the remaining period contains fewer terms than the number of terms\ncovered by the school9s Title IV academic year. For programs that are offered in a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY; see\nChapter 6), the number of terms covered in the school9s Title IV academic year usually does not include a summer\n<header= or <trailer= term.\nConsider a student who is enrolled in a four-year program that is offered in an SAY consisting of three quarters plus a\nsummer trailer, and who has completed four academic years of study. The student needs to attend an additional quarter\nterm to complete the program requirements. The final quarter term falls in a new academic year; therefore the annual\nloan limit must be prorated because the remaining period of study (a single quarter) is less than a full academic year.\nSimilarly, if a student enrolled in a two-year program not offered in an SAY (where the Title IV academic year covers two\n15-week semesters) has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to\ncomplete the program requirements, the loan limit must be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester.\nNote that for standard-term programs or credit-hour programs with SE9W nonstandard terms, the length of the loan\nperiod does not determine whether a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic\nyear. The determining factor is the length of the remaining period of study in which the student is enrolled, which may not\nbe the same as the loan period. For example, if an undergraduate student is enrolled for a full SAY consisting of fall and\nspring semesters, and will complete the program at the end of the spring term, but is enrolled less than half time during\nthe spring, the student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan only for the fall semester. Although the loan period (fall only) is\nshorter than an academic year, the remaining period of study (fall through spring) is a full academic year. Therefore, if the\nstudent receives a Direct Loan in the fall, proration of the annual loan limit is not required.\nIn a clock-hour program, non-term program, or a program with non-SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining\nperiod of study is considered less than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program9s\ndefined Title IV academic year. In contrast to standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, if a student enrolled\nin a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is in a remaining period of study shorter than an\nacademic year and receives a Direct Loan, the loan period and the remaining period of study will always be the same. This\nis because for these programs the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program (or remaining portion of\na program) or the academic year.\nFor all types of programs, you determine the prorated loan limit for a student enrolled in a remaining period of study less\nthan an academic year by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by the following fraction:\nUnlike proration for programs that are shorter than an academic year, there is no comparison of weeks and hours. Only\nthe credit or clock hours that the student is scheduled to attend, or is actually attending, at the time of\norigination are used in the calculation.\nProration Examples: Remaining Periods of Study Shorter Than an Academic Year\nExamples 3 through 7 illustrate how the prorated annual loan limit is determined when a student is enrolled in a\nremaining period of study shorter than an academic year.\nSemester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours enrolled in program\nSemester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours in academic year\nVolume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3: Remaining Period = One Quarter', 'Chapter 5\nLoan Limit Proration\nProration Overview\nThe annual maximum loan amount an undergraduate student may receive must be prorated (reduced) when the borrower\nis:\nEnrolled in a program that is shorter than a full academic year; or\nEnrolled in a program that is one academic year or more in length but is in a remaining period of study (a period of\nstudy at the end of which a student will have completed all requirements of the program) that is shorter than a full\nacademic year.\nWith one exception (see ""Proration of the Annual Loan Limit for Students who Graduate Early From Clock-Hour Programs""\nlater in this chapter), the annual loan limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are prorated only\nin these two situations. Loan limits are not prorated based on a student9s enrollment status, such as when a student is\nenrolled less than full time, or when a student is enrolled for a period of less than a full academic year that is not a\nremaining period of study.\nThe annual loan limit for Direct Unsubsidized Loans is not prorated for students enrolled in graduate or professional level\nprograms. Loan proration requirements also do not apply to students taking preparatory coursework or coursework\nnecessary for teacher certification. This is because the annual loan limit must be prorated only when a student is enrolled\nin a program or remaining portion of a program that is shorter than an academic year. Students taking preparatory\ncoursework or teacher certification coursework are not considered to be enrolled in a program for purposes of awarding\nTitle IV aid.\nIt9s important to understand that loan limit proration determines the maximum loan amount that a student may borrow\nfor a program or remaining balance of a program, not the actual loan amount a student is eligible to receive. In some\ncases, the loan amount a student is eligible to receive (based on costs, SAI, and OFA) may be less than the prorated loan\nlimit.\nUse of Fractions vs. Decimals When Prorating Loan Limits\nAs we explain in more detail below, proration involves multiplying the annual loan limit by a fraction. You may choose to\nconvert the fraction to a decimal and then multiply the annual loan limit by the decimal, but this conversion is not a\nrequirement. However, you should be consistent in the method you use, since the fraction and decimal calculations\nsometimes result in slightly different prorated loan limits, as shown in the examples later in the chapter.\nUsing the School9s Academic Year Definition If Longer Than the Title IV Minimum\nAs explained above, proration of the annual loan limit is required when an undergraduate student is enrolled in a program\nthat is shorter than an academic year or is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year.\nA school may choose to define its academic year as longer in weeks or hours than the minimum statutory requirements. If\nso, the school9s standard 3 not the statutory minimum 3 determines whether a program or a final period of study is shorter\nthan an academic year.\nSeparate Calculations for the Combined Subsidized and Unsubsidized Annual Loan Limit and the Maximum Subsidized\nLoan Limit Proration\n34 CFR 685.203(a), (b), (c)', 'Prorating Loan Limits for Remaining Periods Shorter Than an Academic Year\nYou must also prorate loan limits for students enrolled in remaining periods of study shorter than an academic year. This\ncircumstance can occur when a student is enrolled in a program that is one academic year or more in length, but the\nremaining period of study needed to complete the program (sometimes called a <final= period of study) will be shorter\nthan an academic year.\nProration is required only when you know in advance that a student will be enrolled for a remaining period of study that is\nshorter than an academic year. With one exception, if a student originally enrolls for a remaining period of study that is a\nfull academic year in length, but completes the program in less than a full academic year, there is no requirement to\nretroactively prorate the annual loan limit (for the exception, see <Proration of the Annual Loan Limit for Students Who\nTo determine the maximum portion of the $2,420 prorated annual loan limit that the student may receive in\nsubsidized loan funds, multiply the maximum subsidized annual loan limit of $3,500 by the smaller decimal\n(0.44):\n$3,500 x 0.44 = $1,540 subsidized prorated annual loan limit\nThe maximum combined Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount the student can borrow for\nthe program is $2,420, but no more than $1,540 of this amount may be in subsidized loans.\nNote: In Example 1 above and in the other proration examples that follow, the fractions are converted to\ndecimals. As an alternative you could choose to multiply the annual loan limit by the original fraction, though you\nshould be consistent in using one method or the other. Using the fraction 400/900 in Example 1 instead of the\ndecimal 0.44 would result in a slightly higher prorated loan limit: $5,500 x 400/900 = $2,444.\nVolume 8, Chapter 5, Example 2: Non-Term Credit-Hour Program Shorter Than an Academic Year\nAn independent student is enrolled in a 24 quarter-hour, 20-week program.

In a standard-term program, or a credit-hour program using SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of study is considered shorter than an academic year if the remaining period contains fewer terms than the number of terms covered by the school9s Title IV academic year. For programs that are offered in a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY; see Chapter 6), the number of terms covered in the school9s Title IV academic year usually does not include a summer <header= or <trailer= term. Consider a student who is enrolled in a four-year program that is offered in an SAY consisting of three quarters plus a summer trailer, and who has completed four academic years of study. The student needs to attend an additional quarter term to complete the program requirements. The final quarter term falls in a new academic year; therefore the annual loan limit must be prorated because the remaining period of study (a single quarter) is less than a full academic year. Similarly, if a student enrolled in a two-year program not offered in an SAY (where the Title IV academic year covers two 15-week semesters) has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to complete the program requirements, the loan limit must be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester. Note that for standard-term programs or credit-hour programs with SE9W nonstandard terms, the length of the loan period does not determine whether a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year. The determining factor is the length of the remaining period of study in which the student is enrolled, which may not be the same as the loan period. For example, if an undergraduate student is enrolled for a full SAY consisting of fall and spring semesters, and will complete the program at the end of the spring term, but is enrolled less than half time during the spring, the student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan only for the fall semester. Although the loan period (fall only) is shorter than an academic year, the remaining period of study (fall through spring) is a full academic year. Therefore, if the student receives a Direct Loan in the fall, proration of the annual loan limit is not required. In a clock-hour program, non-term program, or a program with non-SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of study is considered less than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program9s defined Title IV academic year. In contrast to standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, if a student enrolled in a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is in a remaining period of study shorter than an academic year and receives a Direct Loan, the loan period and the remaining period of study will always be the same. This is because for these programs the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program (or remaining portion of a program) or the academic year. For all types of programs, you determine the prorated loan limit for a student enrolled in a remaining period of study less than an academic year by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by the following fraction: Unlike proration for programs that are shorter than an academic year, there is no comparison of weeks and hours. Only the credit or clock hours that the student is scheduled to attend, or is actually attending, at the time of origination are used in the calculation.', '<2-hop>\n\nProration Examples: Remaining Periods of Study Shorter Than an Academic Year Examples 3 through 7 illustrate how the prorated annual loan limit is determined when a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study shorter than an academic year. Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours enrolled in program Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours in academic year Volume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3: Remaining Period = One Quarter']","Proration applies to students in clock-hour programs when their remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year by reducing the annual loan limit based on the number of clock or credit hours the student is scheduled to attend. This is necessary because the remaining period of study does not meet the minimum requirements for a full academic year.

### Proration Process
To determine the prorated loan limit, the following steps are taken:

1. **Identify the Remaining Period of Study**: This is the time left for the student to complete their program.
2. **Calculate the Fraction**: The fraction is determined by comparing the clock or credit hours the student will attend during the remaining period to the total hours defined in the school's academic year.
3. **Multiply by the Annual Loan Limit**: The annual loan limit is then multiplied by this fraction to find the prorated loan limit.

### Examples of Proration
1. **Example of a Student in a Clock-Hour Program**:
   - A student is enrolled in a clock-hour program that requires 900 clock hours for completion. If the student has only 400 clock hours remaining, the fraction would be 400/900.
   - If the annual loan limit is $5,500, the prorated loan limit would be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Prorated Loan Limit} = 5,500 \times \left(\frac{400}{900}\right) = 5,500 \times 0.44 = 2,420
     \]

2. **Example of a Dependent Student in a Two-Year Program**:
   - A dependent student in a two-year credit-hour program has completed two academic years (72 quarter hours) but needs to complete an additional 6 quarter hours in the fall quarter of the next academic year.
   - The school defines the academic year as 36 quarter hours. The fraction for the remaining period of study would be:
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{36 \text{ hours}} = 0.17
     \]
   - If the annual loan limit for a second-year undergraduate is $6,500, the prorated loan limit would be:
     \[
     6,500 \times 0.17 = 1,105
     \]
   - The maximum portion of this amount that can be in subsidized loans (with a limit of $4,500) would be:
     \[
     4,500 \times 0.17 = 765
     \]

3. **Example of a Student Graduating Early**:
   - A student in a program with a defined academic year of 36 quarter hours will attend the fall quarter (12 hours) and the winter quarter (3 hours) but will not attend the spring quarter.
   - The prorated loan limit for the fall quarter would be:
     \[
     \frac{12 \text{ hours}}{36 \text{ hours}} = 0.33
     \]
   - If the annual loan limit is $7,500, the prorated limit would be:
     \[
     7,500 \times 0.33 = 2,475
     \]
   - The maximum subsidized portion would be:
     \[
     5,500 \times 0.33 = 1,815
     \]

In summary, proration for students in clock-hour programs is essential when their remaining study period is shorter than an academic year, and it involves calculating the prorated loan limit based on the hours they will attend compared to the total hours required for the academic year.","In clock-hour programs, if a student's remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year, the loan limit must be prorated. This is because the remaining period consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program's defined Title IV academic year. Unlike standard-term programs, the loan period and the remaining period of study in clock-hour programs will always be the same, as the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program or the academic year. Proration is determined by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by a fraction based on the credit or clock hours the student is scheduled to attend. Examples of this proration process include scenarios where a student is enrolled in a remaining period of one quarter, as illustrated in Volume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3.",1.0,0.8125,0.51,0.9428183095440114,0.2222222219753086,,23.000816106796265,naive_rag
"How does the NSLDS system assist in managing borrower information and loan limits, particularly in relation to unallocated consolidation loan amounts?","['teacher certification and preparatory coursework and the applicable annual loan limits.)\nHigher Aggregate Loan Limit for Certain Health Professions Students\nAs explained earlier in this chapter, graduate and professional students who are enrolled in certain health professions\nprograms are eligible for higher annual Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits. These students also have a higher combined\nsubsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit.\nThe combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit for graduate and professional health professions students\nwho are eligible to receive the increased annual unsubsidized amounts is $224,000. Not more than $65,500 of this\namount may be from subsidized loans (see the notes following Table 4 above regarding the $65,500 subsidized aggregate\nloan limit for graduate and professional students).\nIf a student who received increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts for a qualifying health profession program later\nenrolls in a non-health professions program, the student is no longer eligible for the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan\nlimits. However, the additional loan amounts received for the health professions program are not counted toward the\nnormal aggregate loan limit for that student.\nChecking Remaining Eligibility Under the Aggregate Loan Limits\nBefore originating a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, it9s important to make sure the student still has\nremaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limits. As long as there is no conflicting information, you may rely on the\nfinancial aid history (provided on the ISIR as well as on the NSLDS Professional Access website) and the Transfer Student\nMonitoring process (for transfer students only) to tell you if a student is about to exceed the applicable aggregate loan\nlimit. (See Volume 1, Chapter 3 for more detail on NSLDS financial aid history, which may also affect eligibility for other\nTitle IV programs.)\nThe Loan History in NSLDS for a borrower who has received Title IV loans shows Aggregate Loan Information for the\nborrower9s outstanding subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding\nPrincipal Balance amounts shown for a borrower in NSLDS do not include unpaid accrued interest, capitalized interest\n(unpaid interest that has been added to the principal balance of the loan), or other charges, as these amounts are not\ncounted against the aggregate loan limits.\nFor each individual loan that a borrower has received, NSLDS shows both the Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) and the\nAggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). The OPB is what the borrower owes, which may include capitalized\ninterest and other charges. The Agg. OPB is the portion of the OPB that counts against the aggregate loan limits for\nsubsidized and unsubsidized loans.\nFor instance, suppose a student has a Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursed in the amount of $5,000. Over time, $200 in\ninterest accrues and is capitalized. Assuming that the borrower has made no payments on the loan, the OPB on the loan\nwill be $5,200 (this is the amount the borrower owes), and the Agg. OPB will be $5,000 (this is the amount that is counted\nagainst the aggregate loan limit). If you are looking at information in NSLDS for individual loans, it is the Agg. OPB that\nyou should use to determine the student9s remaining loan eligibility under the applicable aggregate loan limit.\nThe Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance amounts displayed in NSLDS for a borrower\nalso include the outstanding portion of consolidation loans (both Direct Consolidation Loans and Federal Consolidation\nLoans made under the FFEL program) attributable to Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Subsidized\nFederal Stafford Loans, and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans that were repaid by the consolidation loan.\nUnallocated Consolidation Loan Amounts\nNSLDS may also show a <Consolidation Loans, Unallocated= amount that is not counted against a borrower9s aggregate\nloan limits. The <Consolidation Loans, Unallocated= amount represents the portion of a consolidation loan that cannot be\nattributed to other loans in the borrower9s loan history. For example, it may represent capitalized interest or non-Title IV\nloans that were consolidated. You are not responsible for determining the origin of any unallocated consolidation loan\namounts.\nTreatment of Consolidated Perkins Loans and PLUS Loans\nA consolidated Perkins Loan or PLUS loan becomes part of the unsubsidized portion of a consolidation loan, but it is not', 'Repayment of the Excess Loan Amount\nIf a student who has inadvertently overborrowed wishes to regain Title IV eligibility by repaying the excess loan amount,\nthe student must contact the applicable servicer and comply with the servicer9s repayment instructions. The school may\nassist the student in identifying and contacting the servicer, but the student, not the school, must make the payment of\nthe excess loan funds in accordance with the servicer9s instructions. Once the student has repaid the excess loan amount\nin full, the servicer will send the student confirmation that the excess loan amount has been repaid. The student or\nservicer must provide a copy of the repayment confirmation to the school. The inadvertent overborrowing is considered to\nhave been resolved as of the date the servicer received the borrower9s full payment of the excess loan amount.\nSatisfactory Repayment Arrangements (<Reaffirmation=)\nA student who has inadvertently overborrowed may also regain Title IV eligibility by making satisfactory repayment\narrangements to repay the excess loan amount. This requirement can be met if the student agrees in writing to repay the\nexcess amount according to the terms and conditions of the promissory note that supported the loan. This is called\n<reaffirmation.= The reaffirmation process includes the following five steps:\n1. Either the student or the school where the student is requesting additional Title IV funds contacts the servicer of the\nloan that caused the overborrowing and explains that the student has inadvertently overborrowed and wishes to\nreaffirm the debt.\n2. The servicer sends the student a reaffirmation agreement.\n3. The student reads, signs, and returns the reaffirmation agreement to the servicer.\n4. The servicer sends the student confirmation that the reaffirmation agreement has been accepted. The student or\nservicer must provide a copy of the confirmation to the school where the student is requesting Title IV funds.\n5. The inadvertent overborrowing is considered to have been resolved as of the date the servicer receives the student9s\nsigned reaffirmation agreement.\nConsolidation of Loan Amounts That Exceed the Annual or Aggregate Loan Limit\nIf a borrower who inadvertently received more than the annual or aggregate loan limits has consolidated the loan(s) that\ncaused the borrower to exceed the loan limit into a Direct Consolidation Loan, the Direct Consolidation Loan is considered\na satisfactory arrangement to repay the excess amount. This restores the borrower9s eligibility for Title IV aid. If the school\nwhere the student is seeking aid confirms through NSLDS that the loan(s) have been consolidated, no further action is\nrequired. Note, however, that consolidation of an amount that exceeded the combined aggregate loan limit for Direct\nSubsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans does not automatically make a student eligible for additional Direct Loan\nfunds.\nbefore the student can receive additional Title IV aid.\nRegaining Title IV Eligibility After Inadvertent Overborrowing\n34 CFR 668.35(d)\nDCL GEN-15-20\nDCL GEN-13-02\nDepartment of Education Office of the Inspector General Hotline', 'Chapter 3\nDirect Loan Origination, Loan Periods, and Disbursements\nOrigination Overview\nOrigination is the process of creating a Direct Loan award in the school9s system. Before originating a Direct Loan, a\nschool must determine the student9s or parent9s eligibility for the loan. For each Direct Loan that a school disburses to a\nstudent or parent, the school must submit a loan award record to the COD System that includes the student9s grade level,\nthe loan period and academic year dates, the loan amount, the anticipated and actual dates and amounts of the loan\ndisbursements, and other information. Submission of a loan award record serves as the school9s certification that it has\ndetermined the borrower9s eligibility for the loan.\nThe specific Direct Loan amount that a student or parent borrower is eligible to receive is determined based on various\nfactors such as the student9s COA, Student Aid Index (SAI), OFA, and remaining eligibility under the annual and aggregate\nloan limits (see Chapter 4 for guidance on annual and aggregate loan limits). Some of these factors are relevant only\nwhen determining eligibility for certain types of Direct Loans. When originating a Direct Loan, the COA used in\ndetermining the loan amount may include only those costs associated with the period of enrollment (loan period) for\nwhich the loan is being originated.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans have annual and aggregate limits that are the same for all\nstudents at a given grade level and dependency status. You may not originate a Direct Loan for an amount that:\nExceeds the amount requested by the borrower;\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus the student9s SAI and OFA;\nIn the case of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan or Direct PLUS Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus OFA; or\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, would cause the student to exceed the annual or\naggregate limit.\nSee Volume 3, Chapter 3 for more information on packaging Direct Loans as part of a student9s financial aid award.\nOriginating a Loan\nIt9s important to remember that your school, not the Department, is responsible for determining a borrower9s eligibility for\na Direct Loan. Schools that originate and disburse loans to ineligible borrowers, or for loan amounts that exceed loan\nlimits or financial need, are subject to administrative actions such as a fine, limitation, suspension, and termination, as\nwell as liabilities including repayment to the government of interest and costs it has paid on the ineligible loans.\nYou must originate a Direct Loan while the student is enrolled and eligible for the period of enrollment for which the loan\nis intended. You may not originate a loan for a period in which the student is no longer enrolled. For example, you may\nnot originate a loan for a prior academic year that has ended, even if the student is enrolled and eligible for the current\nacademic year. Similarly, if a student who was enrolled at least half time only for the fall and spring quarters of an\nacademic year consisting of fall, winter, and spring quarters does not request a loan until the spring, you may not at that\ntime originate a loan for the previous fall quarter.\nFor all Direct Loans, you must document the student9s COA, SAI, and OFA in the student9s file. This information must be\nmade available to the Department upon request.\nYou must confirm that the borrower meets the definition of eligible borrower by doing the following:\nDetermine that the student is enrolled at least half time and making satisfactory academic progress (see Volume 1);\nReview the NSLDS information on the ISIR or the NSLDS Professional Access website to ensure that the student is not\nin default, does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant or loan (see Volume 1), and will not exceed the annual or\naggregate loan limits (as described in Chapter 4 of this volume);\nEnsure that the amount of the loan, in combination with other aid, will not exceed the student9s financial need or', ""Graduate program in Public Health (including Master's and Doctoral\ndegree programs in Public Health)\nCouncil on Education for Public Health\nDoctor of Chiropractic\nCouncil on Chiropractic Education, Commission\non Accreditation\nDoctoral Degree in Clinical Psychology\nAmerican Psychological Association,\nCommittee on Accreditation\nMaster's or Doctoral Degree in Health Administration\nCommission on Accreditation of Healthcare\nManagement Education\nThe increased unsubsidized amounts that an eligible health professions student may receive are in addition to the regular\n$20,500 Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual loan limit for graduate and professional students. For example, a student\nenrolled in a nine-month Doctor of Dentistry program is eligible for the regular Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual maximum\nfor a graduate or professional student ($20,500), plus the maximum increased unsubsidized amount of $20,000, for a\ntotal Direct Unsubsidized Loan maximum of $40,500 per academic year.\nGraduate and professional students who qualify for the higher annual Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits are also eligible for\na higher combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit, as explained later in this chapter.\nProration of the Increased Health Professions Annual Loan Limit for an Academic Year Covering 10 or 11 Months\nTables 3A and 3B above show the increased unsubsidized loan limits for programs with an academic year of either nine\nmonths or 12 months. For eligible health professions programs with an academic year covering 10 or 11 months, the\nannual additional unsubsidized loan limit must be prorated. If the academic year covers 10 or 11 months, the prorated\nannual loan limit is determined by dividing the applicable loan limit for an academic year covering nine months by nine,\nand then multiplying the result by 10 or 11. For example, the prorated increased unsubsidized loan limit for a Doctor of\nDentistry program with an 11-month academic year would be $24,444, calculated as follows:\n$20,000 ÷ 9 = $2,222.22\n$2,222.22 x 11 = $24,444.42, rounded to $24,444\nForeign Schools May Not Award Increased Unsubsidized Loan Amounts\nForeign schools that participate in the Direct Loan Program may not award the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan\namounts to health professions students.\nAggregate Loan Limit Overview\nAs explained earlier in this chapter, there are limits on the maximum Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan\namounts that a student may receive each academic year (annual loan limits). There are also limits on a student9s\nmaximum outstanding total Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan debt. These are called aggregate loan\nlimits. A borrower who has reached the aggregate borrowing limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized\nLoans may not receive additional loans. Once the loans are repaid, in full or in part, the borrower may apply for additional\nloans.\nTo ensure that a student doesn9t exceed the aggregate loan limits, the student9s FAFSA form data is matched with NSLDS.\nIf the student has exceeded or is approaching the aggregate loan limits, this will be noted in the ISIR. If a student\ntransfers to your school, you must inform NSLDS so that it can begin the Transfer Student Monitoring process.\nAggregate Loan Limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\nThe aggregate loan limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are shown in Table 4 below."", 'Volume 8, Chapter 4, Table 4: Aggregate Limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\nTotal (Subsidized and\nUnsubsidized)\nMaximum\nSubsidized\nDependent undergraduates (excluding those whose parents can9t get\nDirect PLUS Loans)\n$31,000\n$23,000\nIndependent undergraduates (and dependent undergraduates whose\nparents can9t get Direct PLUS Loans)\n$57,500\n$23,000\nGraduate and professional students\n$138,500\n$65,500\nNotes on the aggregate loan limits shown in Table 4:\nThe <Total (Subsidized and Unsubsidized)= column shows the maximum combined outstanding subsidized and\nunsubsidized loan debt for a student.

Here’s how it assists in this process:

1. **Loan History Tracking**: NSLDS provides a comprehensive loan history for borrowers, showing both the Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) and the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). The OPB reflects the total amount owed, including capitalized interest and other charges, while the Agg. OPB indicates the portion that counts against the aggregate loan limits. This distinction is essential for determining a borrower's remaining eligibility for loans.

2. **Aggregate Loan Limits**: The system helps ensure that borrowers do not exceed their aggregate loan limits. It displays the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance amounts for subsidized and unsubsidized loans, which are critical for schools and borrowers to monitor eligibility. For example, if a borrower has a Direct Unsubsidized Loan of $5,000 with $200 in capitalized interest, the Agg. OPB would still be $5,000, which is the amount counted against the aggregate limit.

3. **Unallocated Consolidation Loan Amounts**: NSLDS may show an ""Unallocated"" amount for consolidation loans, which represents portions of a consolidation loan that cannot be attributed to specific loans in the borrower’s history. This could include capitalized interest or non-Title IV loans that were consolidated. Importantly, these unallocated amounts do not count against the borrower’s aggregate loan limits, allowing for a clearer understanding of the borrower's available loan eligibility.

4. **Monitoring and Compliance**: Schools can rely on NSLDS to check a student’s financial aid history and ensure compliance with loan limits before originating new loans. This includes using the information provided in the ISIR (Institutional Student Information Record) and the Transfer Student Monitoring process to prevent overborrowing.

In summary, NSLDS assists in managing borrower information and loan limits by providing detailed loan histories, tracking aggregate loan limits, clarifying the treatment of unallocated consolidation loan amounts, and facilitating compliance monitoring for schools. This comprehensive approach helps maintain the integrity of the federal student loan system and ensures that borrowers are aware of their loan eligibility.","The NSLDS system assists in managing borrower information by providing loan holders with the necessary data during the exit counseling process, as part of the Department's online counseling services.

If the student withdraws without\nnotifying your school, you must confirm that they have completed online counseling or mail exit counseling material to\nthe student at their last known address. You may also email the information to the student9s home (not school) email\naddress if you have it. The PDF version of the Direct Loan Exit Counseling Guide satisfies this requirement. You may also\nsend the student a direct link to the exit counseling materials online. Whatever method you choose must be used within\n30 days of learning that the borrower has withdrawn or failed to participate in an exit counseling session.\nWhen mailing exit materials to a student who has left school, you9re not required to use certified mail with a return receipt\nrequested, but you must document in their file that the materials were sent.

You can also reinforce messages to borrowers. For example, with each\ndisbursement you can remind students about the importance of maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP; see\nVolume 1, Chapter 1 for details on SAP requirements), planning for future employment, and staying in touch with the loan\nservicer. Sample measures for loan counseling are given in the <Sample Default Prevention Plan= that can be found in the\nregulations cited below.\nPLUS Loan Credit Counseling\nSpecial loan counseling is required for any student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has been determined to\nhave an adverse credit history, but who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan either by getting a loan endorser or by\ndocumenting to the satisfaction of the Department that there are extenuating circumstances related to the adverse\ncredit. While the special PLUS Loan Credit Counseling is mandatory only for these borrowers, any PLUS borrower can\nvoluntarily complete this counseling. See Chapter 1 of this volume for more information about adverse credit.\nNote that the special counseling described above is separate from the entrance counseling that all first-time graduate and\nprofessional student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers must complete, as described earlier in this chapter.\nAnnual Student Loan Acknowledgement\nThe Department offers a tool on the StudentAid.gov website called the Annual Student Loan Acknowledgement.

There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default. Your school can also offer financial literacy classes, on a credit or non-credit basis, that include\ninformation on budgeting, debt management, anticipated earnings by profession, elements of loan counseling, etc.,\nthough eligibility for a Direct Loan cannot be contingent on completion of such a class.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrowers\nBelow we provide a summary of the information that must be covered in entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan\nand Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers. For more detailed information, refer to the regulations cited at the end of this\nsection.\nEntrance counseling for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loan borrowers must:\nExplain the use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN);\nEmphasize the importance of the loan repayment obligation;\nDescribe the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, delinquent debt collection procedures\nunder Federal law, and litigation;\nEmphasize that the borrower must repay the full amount of the loan even if the borrower does not complete the\nprogram, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain\nemployment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services\nthat the student paid for with the loan;\nInform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on a range of student levels of\nindebtedness depending on the types of loans the borrower has received, or based on the average indebtedness of\nother borrowers in the same program at the same school;\nExplain how accepting the loan will affect the borrower9s eligibility for other forms of student financial assistance;\nProvide information on how interest accrues and is capitalized during periods when the interest is not paid by either\nthe borrower or the Department;\nInform the borrower of the option to pay the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan while the borrower is in school;\nExplain the definition of half-time enrollment at the school and the consequences of not maintaining half-time\nenrollment;\nExplain the importance of contacting the appropriate offices at the school if the borrower withdraws before\nDirect Loan Entrance Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(a)\nLoan Counseling Requirements and Flexibilities\nDCL GEN-15-06']","[""<1-hop>\n\nprovided by those companies are already offered free of charge through the Department or the borrower's loan servicer; Provide a general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers (i.e. student loan interest deduction); and Require the borrower to provide current information concerning their name, address, Social Security number, references, and driver9s license number and state of issuance, as well as the borrower9s expected permanent address, the address of their next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower9s expected employer, if known (see also < Providing Borrower Information at Separation= below). As stated above, Direct Loan exit counseling must provide borrowers with the information the Department makes available in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA. This section of the law requires the Department to make available to postsecondary schools and other entities a wide variety of information about federal student assistance programs, including information to help students assess the debt burden and repayment obligations that will be incurred as a result of receiving Title IV loans. As noted below under < Counseling Methods,= documentation that a borrower has completed the Department9s online exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan exit counseling requirements. Schools that choose to conduct their own exit counseling can meet the requirement to provide borrowers with the information made available by the Department in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA by providing borrowers with a copy of the Department9s Direct Loan Exit Counseling Guide. Providing Borrower Information at Separation Schools that conduct their own exit counseling must provide the current personal information collected from the student (name, address, references, etc.) to students9 loan servicers within 60 days. Students authorize their school to release information to servicers in the loan promissory note they signed. No further permission is needed.

For more information, see the regulation cited below."", ""<2-hop>\n\nIf you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower has received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of their financial need, and the student is still enrolled for the loan period, you must return the subsidized loan amount for which the student was ineligible and ask the student if they wish to replace the subsidized funds with a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. If the student agrees to accept the unsubsidized loan funds and they also received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the same loan period as the Direct Subsidized Loan, you may increase the amount of the Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursements by the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. If the student did not receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you may originate a new Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. The new Direct Unsubsidized Loan must have the same loan period and disbursement dates as the Direct Subsidized Loan. If the student does not agree to have the excess subsidized loan funds replaced by a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must still return the ineligible Direct Subsidized Loan amount. If you discover that a student received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of financial need after the student is no longer enrolled for the loan period, you are not required to take any action to eliminate the excess subsidized loan amount. If you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower who was eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan instead received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must correct the error (even if the loan period has ended) by submitting a downward adjustment to reduce or eliminate the Direct Unsubsidized Loan, as appropriate, and replacing it with the same amount of Direct Subsidized Loan funds. You may do this either by adjusting an existing Direct Subsidized Loan upwards, or, if the student does not have an existing Direct Subsidized Loan, by originating a new Direct Subsidized Loan. Replacing a Direct Unsubsidized Loan with a Direct Subsidized Loan in this circumstance does not require obtaining the student9s consent. Direct Loan Overawards As explained in Volume 4, Chapter 3, an overaward exists when a student9s aid package exceeds their need or overall COA. If you discover that a student who received Direct Loans has been overawarded and your school has already received and disbursed some or all of the Direct Loan funds, you have the following options: If the student9s aid package includes a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, or a nonfederal education loan, and the aid package doesn9t already apply these loans toward the student9s SAI, you may choose to adjust the aid package to have all or a portion of these loans replace the SAI, thus reducing or eliminating the overaward (for more detail and examples, see <Substituting for the SAI= in Volume 3, Chapter 3). If you have not yet made the second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan, you can reduce or cancel the second or subsequent disbursement. If the overaward situation occurs after the full amount of a Direct Loan has been disbursed, you do not need to adjust the amount of the loan. However, you might have to adjust the aid package to prevent an overaward of Campus-Based funds or to prevent the total aid package from exceeding the student9s need. Although a school isn9t required to return Direct Loan funds that were disbursed to the borrower (either directly or by applying them to the student's account) before the overaward situation occurred, the law doesn9t prevent your school from returning funds that were applied to the student account if you choose to do so. A borrower who receives a direct payment of loan funds is not required to repay an overawarded amount, unless the overaward was caused by the borrower9s misreporting or withholding of information.""]","The Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) facilitates compliance with Direct Loan exit counseling requirements by providing schools with notifications of borrowers who have completed online exit counseling through the Department's StudentAid.gov website. This documentation confirms that the school has fulfilled its responsibility to ensure that students receive the necessary counseling before they cease to be enrolled at least half-time. Additionally, completion information can be accessed via the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) System website, allowing schools to verify that their students have met the exit counseling requirements.

If a student receives excess Direct Subsidized Loan funds, the context does not provide specific actions to take in that situation. However, it is generally advisable for students to contact their loan servicer or the financial aid office at their school to discuss the implications of receiving excess funds and to determine the appropriate steps to rectify the situation, which may include returning the excess funds or adjusting future loan amounts.","The Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) facilitates compliance with Direct Loan exit counseling requirements by notifying schools of online loan counseling completed by borrowers. This ensures that schools are aware of students fulfilling their counseling responsibilities, as completion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If a student receives excess Direct Subsidized Loan funds, the school must return the ineligible amount if the student is still enrolled. The student can choose to replace the excess subsidized funds with a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. If the student agrees, the school may increase the Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursements or originate a new one for the same loan period.

How does the FSA Handbook guide schools in handling loan adjustments for clinical work and the death of a Title IV aid recipient?,"['may not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of\npayments while the student was enrolled at least half time.\nIf a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death,\nthe school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of\nthe original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent\nstudent (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4\nof this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate\na Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended.\nFor additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the\nFSA Handbook.\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term\nVolume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and\nnonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine\nweeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education\nprogram work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical\nWork in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below.\nIf clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard\nterm, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.\nIf a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the\nstarting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of\nthe clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on\nAugust 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not\nbegin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be\nthe beginning date of the term.\nIf the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a\nDirect Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the\ncase).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the\nspring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as\nSeptember 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which\nit is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term.\nIf loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the\nnormal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies,\nand the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of\na fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that\nfall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1\nthrough June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1\nthrough June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for\ninformation on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits).\nIf there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work,\nand the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to\nbegin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two\nloan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.', 'Volume 8\nThe Direct Loan Program\nIntroduction\nUnder the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loan Program), the U.S. Department of Education (the\nDepartment) makes loans to help students and parents pay the cost of attendance (COA) at a postsecondary school. This\nvolume of the Federal Student Aid Handbook provides information to assist schools in determining student and parent\neligibility for Direct Loans, counseling student borrowers, and awarding Direct Loans.\nChanges for 2025-2026\nWe have made the following changes in Volume 8 for 2025-2026:\nIn Chapter 3, we have revised the discussion of loan periods to provide a limited exception to the longstanding\nrequirement that the loan period for a Direct Loan may not include any terms in which the borrower is ineligible to\nreceive Direct Loan funds.\nAlso in Chapter 3, we have added a slightly revised and expanded version of guidance on the treatment of Direct\nLoan disbursements made after the date of a borrower9s death that was previously in Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the FSA\nHandbook under the heading <Checking Eligibility at the Time of Disbursement.= Because this guidance is specific to\nDirect Loans, we believe Volume 8 is a more appropriate location.\nIn Chapter 5, we have revised Example 6 to reflect the limited exception to the requirement that a loan period may\nnot include terms in which the borrower is ineligible (see Chapter 3 changes above).\nIn Chapter 7, we have revised the discussion of transfer students and abbreviated loan periods to clarify that in some\ncircumstances a transfer student may be eligible to receive more Direct Loan funds for the program at the new\nschool than a non-transfer student would be eligible to receive for that same program.\nExcept as noted above, there are no other substantive changes to Volume 8 for 2025-2026.', 'Regardless of the counseling methods your school uses, it must document that the student received entrance and exit\ncounseling, and it must ensure that an individual with expertise in the Title IV programs is reasonably available shortly\nafter the counseling to answer the student9s questions.\nCounseling for Correspondence and Study Abroad Students\nIf a first-time student borrower has enrolled in a study-abroad program (approved by a U.S. school for credit) or a\ncorrespondence or distance learning program, the school must document that the student has completed online entrance\ncounseling that meets the regulatory Direct Loan entrance counseling requirements or provide written entrance\ncounseling information by mail or email before making the first disbursement of a Direct Loan to the student.\nIn the case of exit counseling for correspondence programs or study abroad programs, the school may mail or email the\nborrower written counseling materials within 30 days after the borrower completes the program, with a request that they\nprovide the contact and personal information that would ordinarily have been collected through the counseling process.\nProviding Additional Information\nYour school can take additional steps to counsel students, such as assisting them with developing a budget, estimating\nneed for loans, and planning for repayment. You can also reinforce messages to borrowers. For example, with each\ndisbursement you can remind students about the importance of maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP; see\nVolume 1, Chapter 1 for details on SAP requirements), planning for future employment, and staying in touch with the loan\nservicer.

If the student withdraws without\nnotifying your school, you must confirm that they have completed online counseling or mail exit counseling material to\nthe student at their last known address. You may also email the information to the student9s home (not school) email\naddress if you have it. The PDF version of the Direct Loan Exit Counseling Guide satisfies this requirement. You may also\nsend the student a direct link to the exit counseling materials online. Whatever method you choose must be used within\n30 days of learning that the borrower has withdrawn or failed to participate in an exit counseling session.\nWhen mailing exit materials to a student who has left school, you9re not required to use certified mail with a return receipt\nrequested, but you must document in their file that the materials were sent. If they don9t provide updated contact\ninformation, you don9t need to take further action.\nThe required content of exit counseling is summarized in the section that follows. For more detailed information, refer to\nthe regulations cited at the end of the section.\nRequired Exit Counseling Content\nExit counseling must:\nInform the student borrower of the average anticipated monthly repayment amount based on the student borrower9s\nindebtedness or on the average indebtedness of student borrowers who have received Direct Loans for attendance\nat the same school or in the same program of study at the same school;\nReview all available Direct Loan repayment plan options, including a description of the different features of each plan\nand sample information showing the average anticipated monthly payments, and the difference in interest paid and\ntotal payments under each plan;\nExplain the options to prepay each loan, to pay each loan on a shorter schedule, and to change repayment plans;\nProvide information on the effects of loan consolidation;\nInclude debt management strategies that are designed to facilitate repayment;\nExplain to the borrower how to contact their loan servicer;\nExplain the use of an MPN;\nEmphasize the importance of the loan repayment obligation;\nEmphasize that the borrower must repay the full amount of the loan even if the borrower does not complete the\nprogram, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain\nemployment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services\nthat the student paid for with the loan;\nDescribe the likely consequences of default;\nProvide a general description of the terms and conditions under which a borrower may obtain full or partial\nforgiveness or discharge of a loan, defer repayment of a loan, or be granted forbearance on a loan;\nProvide a copy, either in print or by electronic means, of the information the Department makes available in\naccordance with section 485(d) of the HEA (see below);\nReview information on the availability of the Department9s Student Loan Ombudsman9s office;\nInform the borrower of the availability of Title IV loan information in NSLDS and how NSLDS can be used to obtain\nTitle IV loan status information;\nInform the borrower that (1) they may be contacted during the repayment period by third-party student debt relief\ncompanies; (2) the borrower should use caution when dealing with those companies; and (3) the services typically']","['<1-hop>\n\nmay not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of payments while the student was enrolled at least half time. If a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death, the school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent student (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4 of this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.', '<2-hop>\n\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and nonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","The FSA Handbook provides specific guidance for schools on how to handle loan adjustments in two key situations: when a Title IV aid recipient dies and when clinical work is included in a standard term.

1. **Handling Loan Adjustments for the Death of a Title IV Aid Recipient**:
   - If a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan dies, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a new Direct PLUS Loan to cover the amount that must be returned. If this is not possible, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, up to the amounts typically available to independent undergraduates.
   - In this situation, schools are allowed to originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For further actions required when a Title IV aid recipient dies, schools should refer to Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.

2. **Loan Adjustments Related to Clinical Work**:
   - The Handbook outlines that if clinical work is included in a standard term or a substantially equal nonstandard term (SE9W) and meets specific criteria, exceptions to normal loan period and disbursement rules may apply. 
   - For instance, if clinical work begins before the term starts, the loan period start date is adjusted to the beginning of the clinical work. Conversely, if the clinical work ends after the term's end date, the loan period end date is adjusted to the end of the clinical work.
   - Schools must report the adjusted loan period dates accordingly, ensuring that the academic year period and payment period dates are also adjusted to reflect these changes.

These guidelines ensure that schools manage loan adjustments appropriately in the event of a borrower’s death and when clinical work impacts the academic calendar.","The FSA Handbook provides guidance for schools on handling loan adjustments in two specific scenarios. Firstly, when a Title IV aid recipient dies, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original loan that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended. This is detailed in Appendix B of the FSA Handbook. Secondly, for clinical work included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the FSA Handbook allows for exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules. If clinical work begins before or ends after the normal term dates, the loan period start and end dates must be adjusted accordingly. This ensures that the academic year period and payment period dates align with the clinical work schedule, as explained in Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook.",1.0,1.0,0.78,0.9378246396442812,0.24999999979166665,0.13043478260869565,9.371248960494995,naive_rag

There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'If your school participates in the Direct PLUS program but a student9s parent cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the\nstudent is allowed to borrow additional unsubsidized funds (see <Criteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan Funds= in Chapter 4 of this volume).\nRequired Counseling for Direct PLUS Loan Applicants With Adverse Credit\nAny student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has an adverse credit history but qualifies by obtaining an endorser\nor documenting that there are extenuating circumstances must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling on the\nDepartment9s StudentAid.gov website.\nAdverse Credit History and Default\nAlthough a default on a Title IV loan will generally appear in a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant9s credit record\nand result in the individual being determined to have an adverse credit history, being in default on a Title IV loan and\nhaving an adverse credit history are separate eligibility issues. A Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified through the\nDepartment9s National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as being in default on a Title IV loan and who has also been\ndetermined to have an adverse credit history (due to the default and/or other adverse credit conditions) cannot qualify for\na Direct PLUS Loan simply by obtaining an endorser or by providing acceptable documentation of extenuating\ncircumstances. The applicant must also separately resolve the default status by one of the means discussed under\n<Resolving Default Status= in Volume 1, Chapter 3.\nIn some cases, the Direct PLUS Loan credit check may not reveal a default on a Title IV loan, particularly if the default is\nnot recent. If a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified in NSLDS as being in default on a Title IV\nloan does not have any other adverse credit issues, the applicant will pass the PLUS credit check. In this circumstance you\ncannot assume that the approved credit check result supersedes the information in NSLDS. The default must be resolved\nbefore you can disburse Direct PLUS Loan funds or other Title IV aid to the applicant.\nDirect PLUS Loan Application\nSchools that offer Direct PLUS Loans have the option of requiring student and parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants to\ncomplete the Direct PLUS Loan Application (formally known as the ""Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request for Supplemental\nInformation"") on the Department\'s StudentAid.gov website as the first step in applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. The Direct\nPLUS Loan Application collects the requested loan amount, the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended, and\nother information related to processing the requested Direct PLUS Loan.\nUse of the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov is not required. Schools may choose to develop their own\nprocesses for obtaining the information needed to originate Direct PLUS Loans.\nAlthough the Department9s FAFSA Processing System (FPS) matches student Direct PLUS Loan applicants against NSLDS\nto determine if they are in default on a Title IV loan, it does not perform this match for parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants.\nHowever, the Department conducts an NSLDS default check on all Direct PLUS Loan applicants (both students and\nparents) who complete the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov.\nSchools that use the Direct PLUS Loan Application are notified of the result of the NSLDS default check through the\nCommon Origination and Disbursement (COD) System. The result is reported as one of the following values:\n""N"" = The borrower is not in default on any Title IV loan.\nDefinition of <Adverse Credit History=\n34 CFR 685.200(c)(2)(viii)(B)\n34 CFR 685.200(b)(5)', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default. Your school can also offer financial literacy classes, on a credit or non-credit basis, that include\ninformation on budgeting, debt management, anticipated earnings by profession, elements of loan counseling, etc.,\nthough eligibility for a Direct Loan cannot be contingent on completion of such a class.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrowers\nBelow we provide a summary of the information that must be covered in entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan\nand Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers.

For example, if a student9s biological or legal adoptive parents are divorced, they may decide to each take out a\nDirect PLUS Loan for an agreed upon amount (not to exceed the student9s COA, minus other financial assistance (OFA)) to\nhelp pay for the cost of the student9s education.\nRequirement for Dependent Students To File a FAFSA Form\nIn all cases, the dependent student on whose behalf a parent has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan must have filed a FAFSA\nform and received an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or FAFSA Submission Summary (see Chapter 1 of the\nApplication and Verification Guide for information on the ISIR and FAFSA Submission Summary). This requirement ensures\nthat student eligibility data matches are conducted to verify that the dependent student on whose behalf the parent is\nborrowing:\nIs not in default on a Title IV loan and does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant;\nHas had their Social Security number verified by the Social Security Administration; and\nHas had their citizenship status confirmed by either the Social Security Administration or the Department of\nHomeland Security.\nNote that this requirement is for the student to submit a FAFSA form. It is not a requirement for the parent borrower to\nsubmit a FAFSA form in the parent9s name, and it does not preclude an otherwise eligible parent whose information is not\nincluded on the FAFSA form (sometimes referred to as a <non-custodial= parent) from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan.\nBefore originating a Direct PLUS Loan for a parent borrower, schools must review the ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary\nof the dependent student to ensure there are no student eligibility issues that must be resolved before the parent can\nreceive the Direct PLUS Loan.\nAdverse Credit History\nAn individual with an adverse credit history is prohibited from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan unless they meet additional\neligibility requirements. The Department obtains a credit report on each student or parent applicant for a Direct PLUS\nLoan. An applicant is considered to have an adverse credit history if:\nThey have one or more debts with a total combined outstanding balance greater than $2,085 that (1) are 90 or more\ndays delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or (2) have been placed in collection or charged-off during the two\nyears preceding the date of the credit report; or\nDuring the five years preceding the date of the credit report, the applicant has been determined to be in default on a\ndebt; has had debts discharged in bankruptcy; or has been the subject of foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage\ngarnishment, or write-off of a Title IV debt.\nFor Direct PLUS Loan eligibility purposes, <charged-off= means a debt that has been written off as a loss, but that is still\nsubject to collection action. <In collection= means a debt that has been placed with a collection agency by a creditor or\nthat is subject to more intensive efforts by a creditor to recover amounts owed from a borrower who has not responded\nsatisfactorily to the routine demands of the creditor9s billing procedures.\nAn applicant cannot be denied a Direct PLUS Loan because they have no credit history. That is, the absence of a credit\nhistory is not considered to be adverse credit.\nThere are two means by which a Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit history can still qualify for a Direct\nPLUS Loan. One option is for the applicant to obtain an endorser who doesn9t have an adverse credit history. An endorser\nis someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower doesn9t repay it. For a parent borrower, the\nendorser may not be the dependent student for whom the parent is borrowing.\nAs an alternative to obtaining an endorser, an applicant who has been determined to have an adverse credit history may\nalso qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan by submitting documentation to the Department showing that there are extenuating\ncircumstances associated with the adverse credit. The Department has the final decision on determining whether\nextenuating circumstances exist.\nA borrower who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting to the satisfaction of the\nDepartment that extenuating circumstances exist must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling, as discussed below.']","['<1-hop>\n\nEffect of a Change in Student Status on Aggregate Loan Limits In some cases, a student may qualify for higher loan limits but then lose eligibility for the higher limits due to a change in status. One such situation is when a dependent undergraduate qualifies for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, but in a subsequent academic year the student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan. In this circumstance the dependent student no longer qualifies for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. During any academic year when a dependent student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student is subject to the dependent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student otherwise would have been eligible to receive under the dependent undergraduate annual loan limits are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the $31,000 combined subsidized and unsubsidized dependent undergraduate aggregate limit (see Example 3 below). A similar situation occurs when a student who received loans for a graduate or professional degree program later returns to school and enrolls in an undergraduate program. The student is then subject to the undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student previously received as an undergraduate are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the undergraduate aggregate loan limit (see Example 2 earlier in this chapter). Volume 8, Chapter 4, Example 3: Aggregate Loan Limits and Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Amounts When Parents Are Unable To Obtain Direct PLUS Loans A dependent student receives additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the additional amounts available to independent undergraduates) for the first three years of a four-year program because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan for each of those years. For each of the first three years, the student receives the maximum subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts under the independent student annual loan limits (remember that the annual subsidized maximums are the same for dependent and independent undergraduates): First Year (independent student loan limit) $3,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Second Year (independent student loan limit) $4,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Third Year (independent student loan limit) $5,500 subsidized $7,000 unsubsidized ($5,000 more than dependent maximum) Total $13,500 subsidized $19,000 unsubsidized ($13,000 more than dependent maximum) In the fourth year, the parent is eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, so the student is then subject to the annual and aggregate loan limits for a dependent undergraduate. The dependent student received a total of $13,500 in Direct Subsidized Loan funds and $19,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds ($32,500 combined subsidized and unsubsidized total) for the first three years when the student9s parent was unable to obtain Direct PLUS Loans. These are the same amounts that an independent student who qualified for the maximum annual loan limit each year could have received. If the student9s parent had been able to receive Direct PLUS Loans during each of the first three years and the student received the maximum subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts under the', '<2-hop>\n\nEntrance Counseling Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. For this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student who requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before the authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan to a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling. Entrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are about to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person counseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. If entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable steps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the terms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the borrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic document. Your school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer students9 questions.

However, your entrance counseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements are reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that unreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling can include one or more of the following: Extra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods; A requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though you cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan); A requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or A requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.']","If a student's parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student's eligibility for a Direct Unsubsidized Loan does not change. The student can still borrow Direct Unsubsidized Loans regardless of the parent's eligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan. However, if the parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan due to adverse credit history, the student may be allowed to borrow additional unsubsidized funds.

Entrance counseling plays a crucial role in this process. It is required for all first-time student borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and student Direct PLUS Loans. This counseling provides essential information about the terms and conditions of the loans, the borrower's responsibilities, and the implications of borrowing. Schools must ensure that students complete this counseling before the first disbursement of their loans. 

In summary, while a parent's eligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect a student's Direct Unsubsidized Loan eligibility, entrance counseling is a mandatory step that informs the student about their borrowing and repayment obligations.","If a dependent student's parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student no longer qualifies for the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits.

What are the conditions under which a dependent undergraduate student can receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan if their parents refuse to file a FAFSA form?,"['information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form\nIf you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information\nsections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the\nstudent, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up\nto the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent\nsecond-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume\nfor information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of\nthe other Title IV programs.\nSelf-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or\nhave refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated\nstatement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students\nwithout parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide.\nDirect PLUS Loans\nDirect PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate\nstudents.\nA parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who\nmeets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a\nstudent. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is\nineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent\nwho had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements\noutlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal\ngovernment holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s\nineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student\nis otherwise eligible.\nRequirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers\nSchools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan\nProgram and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available\nto both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students. For more information, see the\ndiscussion under <Direct PLUS Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDefinition of <Parent= for Direct PLUS Loan Purposes\nIf they meet all other Direct PLUS Loan eligibility requirements, the following individuals can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on\nbehalf of a dependent undergraduate student:\nThe student9s biological parent;\nThe student9s legal adoptive parent; or\nThe student9s stepparent (spouse of the student9s biological or legal adoptive parent at the time of application), but\nonly if the stepparent is required to provide their information on the FAFSA form in accordance with the instructions\non the FAFSA form.\nGrandparents and other family members are not eligible to take out Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent\nundergraduate student unless they have legally adopted the student.\nIn addition to the parent(s) whose resources are reported on a student9s FAFSA form, any otherwise eligible biological or\nlegal adoptive parent of the dependent undergraduate student can also take out a Direct PLUS Loan on the student9s\nbehalf, even if that parent9s information is not reported on the FAFSA form.\nNote also that more than one parent can take out a Direct PLUS Loan on behalf of the same dependent undergraduate', 'Chapter 1\nStudent and Parent Eligibility for Direct Loans\nOverview\nTo be eligible for Direct Loans, a student must be enrolled on at least a half-time basis at a school that participates in the\nDirect Loan Program, and students and parents must meet the general federal student aid eligibility requirements\ncovered in Volume 1 of the Federal Student Aid Handbook. This chapter discusses other eligibility requirements that are\nspecific to the Direct Loan Program.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\nOnly students who have financial need may receive Direct Subsidized Loans. The federal government does not charge\ninterest on Direct Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled on at least a half-time basis, during the grace and\ndeferment periods, and during certain other periods (for example, during certain periods of repayment under certain\nrepayment plans that determine the required monthly payment amount based on the borrower9s income and family size).\nIf a student has received a determination of need for a Direct Subsidized Loan in an amount of $200 or less, a school may\nchoose not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and may instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan.\nFinancial need is not an eligibility requirement to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. The federal government generally\ncharges interest on Direct Unsubsidized Loans during all periods, with limited exceptions (for example, during periods of\ndeferment for cancer treatment).\nTo be eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, an undergraduate student attending a\nschool that participates in the Federal Pell Grant Program must first have received a determination of their Pell Grant\neligibility for the period of enrollment for which the student is requesting a loan.\nNo Minimum Age To Receive a Direct Loan\nStudents who are minors may receive Direct Loans, but they may not refuse to repay the loans based on a <defense of\ninfancy= (that is, by claiming that they were too young to enter into the contract of signing the promissory note).\nRequirement To Offer Both Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans\nDirect Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are two components of a single loan program. A school may not choose\nto make only Direct Subsidized Loans or only Direct Unsubsidized Loans available to its eligible students. For more\nDirect Loan Program Regulations\n34 CFR Part 685\nNo Defense of Infancy\nHigher Education Act (HEA) Sec. 484A(b)(2)', 'student. For example, if a student9s biological or legal adoptive parents are divorced, they may decide to each take out a\nDirect PLUS Loan for an agreed upon amount (not to exceed the student9s COA, minus other financial assistance (OFA)) to\nhelp pay for the cost of the student9s education.\nRequirement for Dependent Students To File a FAFSA Form\nIn all cases, the dependent student on whose behalf a parent has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan must have filed a FAFSA\nform and received an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or FAFSA Submission Summary (see Chapter 1 of the\nApplication and Verification Guide for information on the ISIR and FAFSA Submission Summary). This requirement ensures\nthat student eligibility data matches are conducted to verify that the dependent student on whose behalf the parent is\nborrowing:\nIs not in default on a Title IV loan and does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant;\nHas had their Social Security number verified by the Social Security Administration; and\nHas had their citizenship status confirmed by either the Social Security Administration or the Department of\nHomeland Security.\nNote that this requirement is for the student to submit a FAFSA form. It is not a requirement for the parent borrower to\nsubmit a FAFSA form in the parent9s name, and it does not preclude an otherwise eligible parent whose information is not\nincluded on the FAFSA form (sometimes referred to as a <non-custodial= parent) from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan.\nBefore originating a Direct PLUS Loan for a parent borrower, schools must review the ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary\nof the dependent student to ensure there are no student eligibility issues that must be resolved before the parent can\nreceive the Direct PLUS Loan.\nAdverse Credit History\nAn individual with an adverse credit history is prohibited from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan unless they meet additional\neligibility requirements. The Department obtains a credit report on each student or parent applicant for a Direct PLUS\nLoan. An applicant is considered to have an adverse credit history if:\nThey have one or more debts with a total combined outstanding balance greater than $2,085 that (1) are 90 or more\ndays delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or (2) have been placed in collection or charged-off during the two\nyears preceding the date of the credit report; or\nDuring the five years preceding the date of the credit report, the applicant has been determined to be in default on a\ndebt; has had debts discharged in bankruptcy; or has been the subject of foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage\ngarnishment, or write-off of a Title IV debt.\nFor Direct PLUS Loan eligibility purposes, <charged-off= means a debt that has been written off as a loss, but that is still\nsubject to collection action. <In collection= means a debt that has been placed with a collection agency by a creditor or\nthat is subject to more intensive efforts by a creditor to recover amounts owed from a borrower who has not responded\nsatisfactorily to the routine demands of the creditor9s billing procedures.\nAn applicant cannot be denied a Direct PLUS Loan because they have no credit history. That is, the absence of a credit\nhistory is not considered to be adverse credit.\nThere are two means by which a Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit history can still qualify for a Direct\nPLUS Loan. One option is for the applicant to obtain an endorser who doesn9t have an adverse credit history. An endorser\nis someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower doesn9t repay it. For a parent borrower, the\nendorser may not be the dependent student for whom the parent is borrowing.\nAs an alternative to obtaining an endorser, an applicant who has been determined to have an adverse credit history may\nalso qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan by submitting documentation to the Department showing that there are extenuating\ncircumstances associated with the adverse credit. The Department has the final decision on determining whether\nextenuating circumstances exist.\nA borrower who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting to the satisfaction of the\nDepartment that extenuating circumstances exist must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling, as discussed below.', 'For dependent undergraduate students (excluding dependent undergraduates whose parents are unable to obtain Direct\nPLUS Loans), the combined Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual loan limits are shown in Table 1A\nbelow.\nThe <Total (Subsidized and Unsubsidized)= limits in Table 1A represent the total of all Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct\nUnsubsidized Loans a dependent undergraduate student may borrow at each level of study for a single academic year.\nFor example, a dependent first-year undergraduate may receive up to $5,500 in Direct Subsidized Loans and/or Direct\nUnsubsidized Loans for a single academic year, but no more than $3,500 of this amount may be subsidized. A dependent\nfirst-year undergraduate who has no subsidized loan eligibility may receive up to the full $5,500 in Direct Unsubsidized\nLoans.\nVolume 8, Chapter 4, Table 1A: Dependent Undergraduate Annual Limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct\nUnsubsidized Loans\nDependent Undergraduates (Excluding Dependent Students\nWhose Parents Can9t Get Direct PLUS Loans)\nTotal (Subsidized and\nUnsubsidized)\nMaximum\nSubsidized\nFirst Year\n$5,500\n$3,500\nSecond Year\n$6,500\n$4,500\nThird Year and Beyond\n$7,500\n$5,500\nAnnual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates\nThe maximum Direct Subsidized Loan amount that an undergraduate student may receive each academic year is the\nsame for both dependent and independent undergraduates. However, there are higher Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual\nloan limits for independent undergraduate students and for dependent undergraduates whose parents are unable to\nobtain Direct PLUS Loans. For these students, the combined Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual\nloan limits are shown below in Table 1B.\nAs with the loan limits for dependent undergraduates, the <Total (Subsidized and Unsubsidized)= limits represent the total\nof all Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans that an independent undergraduate student (or a dependent\nundergraduate whose parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan) may borrow at each level of study, for a single\nacademic year. For example, an independent, first-year undergraduate may receive up to $9,500 in Direct Subsidized\nLoans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans for a single academic year, but no more than $3,500 of this amount may be\nsubsidized. An independent first-year undergraduate who has no subsidized loan eligibility may receive up to the full\n$9,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds.\nAlthough a dependent undergraduate whose parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan has access to the same higher\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan annual loan limits as an independent undergraduate at the same grade level, the student is still\nconsidered to be a dependent student for all other Title IV purposes.\nFor more detail on the conditions under which a dependent undergraduate can receive increased Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan amounts, see <Criteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Funds= below.\nVolume 8, Chapter 4, Table 1B: Independent Undergraduate Annual Limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct\nUnsubsidized Loans\nIndependent Undergraduates (and Dependent Undergraduates\nWhose Parents Can9t Get Direct PLUS Loans)\nTotal (Subsidized and\nUnsubsidized)\nMaximum\nSubsidized', 'COA (see Volume 3, Chapter 3);\nFor parents receiving a Direct PLUS Loan, ensure that the student has completed a FAFSA form (review the student9s\nISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary); and\nEnsure that the loan disbursement dates meet cash management and disbursement requirements.\nFor a Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loan, you must also:\nDetermine the student9s Pell Grant eligibility and, if they are eligible, include the grant in the student9s aid package;\nFor a Direct Unsubsidized Loan made to an undergraduate student, first determine the student9s eligibility for a\nDirect Subsidized Loan and, if the student is eligible, include the Direct Subsidized Loan in the student9s aid package;\nEnsure that the amount of the loan will not exceed the student9s annual or aggregate loan limits; and\nProrate the annual loan limit for an undergraduate enrolled in a program or remaining period of study that is shorter\nthan an academic year (as described in Chapter 5 of this volume).\nNo Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods Other Than Nine Months\nIf you originate a Direct Loan for a period shorter than a full academic year (for example, a loan for a single term or for a\nprogram shorter than an academic year), the loan amount must be based on the reduced costs for that shorter period of\nenrollment rather than the costs for the full academic year. However, as explained in Volume 3, Chapter 3, there are no\nalternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months comparable to the alternate EFCs for periods other than\nnine months that were used prior to the 2024-2025 award year. In all cases you must use the student9s full calculated 9-\nmonth SAI in the formula to determine financial need for Direct Subsidized Loans and other need-based aid even though\nthe COA will reflect the reduced costs for the shorter loan period. This means that students enrolled for periods shorter\nthan nine months will have less financial need than would have been the case in the past when using a smaller alternate\nEFC, because now the full calculated SAI must be subtracted from the reduced COA for the shorter period of enrollment\nwhen determining financial need for purposes of Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility.\nVolume 8, Chapter 3, Example 1: Effect of No Alternate SAI on Financial Need When Originating Loans for Periods\nLess Than Nine Months\nA first-year dependent student has a COA of $10,800 for an academic year consisting of the fall and spring\nsemesters and an SAI of 8,000, so the student9s financial need for the fall-spring enrollment period is $2,800 (see\nVolume 3, Chapter 3 for guidance on determining financial need). The student is not eligible for a Pell Grant and\nreceives no Title IV aid except for Direct Loans. The student qualifies for a $2,800 Direct Subsidized Loan to fully\ncover their financial need. (The student could also receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, but for purposes of this\nexample we cover only Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility.)\nThe student will also be enrolled for the summer term, which the school treats as a <trailer= to the preceding fall-\nspring Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) for purposes of monitoring annual loan limits (see Chapter 6 of this\nVolume). The summer term is four months in length and the COA for that term is $4,000. For students who attend\nthe summer term and request Direct Loan funds, the school9s normal practice is to originate a separate loan for\nthe summer term only. Because there is no alternate SAI for periods of enrollment less than nine months and the\nstudent9s SAI of 8,000 is greater than the summer term COA, the student has no financial need for summer and is\ntherefore ineligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan for that term (but could receive a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan).\nAs an alternative to originating a separate summer-only loan, the school could choose to originate a single loan\nfor a loan period covering the fall-spring SAY plus the summer trailer term. The student9s COA for that period of\nenrollment is $14,800. Subtracting the student9s SAI of 8,000 from the COA results in financial need of $6,800.\nThe student would therefore be eligible to receive a $3,500 Direct Subsidized Loan (the maximum subsidized\nannual loan limit for a dependent first-year student) for the fall-spring-summer loan period.']","['information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07. Direct Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form If you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information sections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the student, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up to the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent second-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume for information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of the other Title IV programs.

Note, however, that a parent9s ineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student is otherwise eligible. Requirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers Schools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan Program and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available to both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students.

According to the provided context, the following conditions must be met:

1. **Verification of Parental Refusal**: The school must verify that the parents have indeed refused to complete the parental information sections of the FAFSA form. This verification cannot be based solely on self-certification from the student; it typically requires a signed and dated statement from one of the student's parents.

2. **Professional Judgment**: The financial aid administrator at the school may exercise professional judgment to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. This decision allows the student to receive an amount up to the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate student.

3. **Loan Limits**: For example, a dependent second-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds under these circumstances.

4. **Exclusion from Other Aid**: It is important to note that if the student is granted a Direct Unsubsidized Loan under these conditions, they will not be eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans or other Title IV programs.

In contrast, an independent undergraduate taking the\nsame preparatory coursework could receive up to $12,500 per academic year, not more than $5,500 of which could be\nsubsidized.\nLoan limits for preparatory coursework and teacher certification coursework are not subject to proration (see Chapter 5 of\nthis volume) if the coursework is less than a full academic year.\nCombined Undergraduate and Graduate Programs\nSome programs combine undergraduate and graduate study and allow a student to complete both a bachelor\'s degree\nand a graduate or professional degree within the same program. These are referred to as ""dual degree programs."" For\ninstance, a school could offer a 5-year dual degree program leading to both a bachelor\'s degree and a graduate or\nprofessional degree and could define the first three or four years of study as being at the undergraduate level, and the\nremaining year(s) of study as being at the graduate or professional level.

For instance, if your school accepts 30 semester hours of a student9s work in a previous baccalaureate program\ntoward the requirements for a BS in Chemistry at your school and, on that basis, classifies the student at the second-year\nlevel, then the student would be eligible for second-year undergraduate loan limits (see <Loan Limit When a\nBaccalaureate or Associate Degree Is Required for Admission to an Undergraduate Program= earlier in this chapter for the\nloan limit that applies when a student is required to have a prior associate or baccalaureate degree as a condition for\nbeing admitted to an undergraduate program).\nStudents Who Transfer From a Graduate Program to an Undergraduate Program During an Academic Year\nIf a student transfers from a graduate program to an undergraduate program in the middle of an academic year, the\nundergraduate annual loan limit for the student9s grade level applies but amounts previously borrowed at the graduate\nlevel within the same academic year do not count against the undergraduate annual loan limit.

This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'Direct Loan Eligibility After an Enrollment Status Change\nIf a student who received a disbursement of Direct Loan funds prior to the first day of classes of a payment period begins\nattendance on a less-than-half-time basis, there is no requirement for the school or the student to return the loan funds as\nlong as:\nThe student began attendance in at least one course during the payment period; and\nAt the time of the loan disbursement the student was enrolled (registered) for classes on at least a half-time basis.\nHowever, the school must not make any subsequent disbursements of the loan unless the student resumes enrollment on\nat least a half-time basis during the payment period.\nA student who is no longer enrolled at least half time may not receive as a late disbursement any second or subsequent\ndisbursement of the loan.\nNote that different requirements apply if a student who received a Direct Loan disbursement prior to the first day of\nclasses fails to begin attendance in any classes. See <When A Student Fails to Begin Attendance= in Volume 4, Chapter 3.\nIf a student does not withdraw but ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a school may make a late\ndisbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred by the student for a period in which the student was eligible.

Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of a Direct Loan\nuntil a student has begun attendance in enough hours to establish half-time enrollment status. However, if a school has\nnot yet made a Direct Loan disbursement to a student who has dropped classes, and the school determines that the\nstudent never began attendance in enough classes to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a\nfirst disbursement of a Direct Loan to that student.\nLikewise, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules drops all future classes before beginning attendance in\nenough modules to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan\nbecause the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis.

For\ndependent undergraduates enrolled in preparatory coursework or teacher certification programs, there is just a single\nannual loan limit representing the maximum amount of subsidized and/or unsubsidized loans that the student may\nreceive for an academic year.\nFor example, a dependent undergraduate taking preparatory coursework required for enrollment in a graduate or\nprofessional program could receive up to $5,500 per academic year in Direct Loan funds, which could be all subsidized, all\nunsubsidized, or a combination of subsidized and unsubsidized. In contrast, an independent undergraduate taking the\nsame preparatory coursework could receive up to $12,500 per academic year, not more than $5,500 of which could be\nsubsidized.\nLoan limits for preparatory coursework and teacher certification coursework are not subject to proration (see Chapter 5 of\nthis volume) if the coursework is less than a full academic year.\nCombined Undergraduate and Graduate Programs\nSome programs combine undergraduate and graduate study and allow a student to complete both a bachelor\'s degree\nand a graduate or professional degree within the same program. These are referred to as ""dual degree programs."" For\ninstance, a school could offer a 5-year dual degree program leading to both a bachelor\'s degree and a graduate or\nprofessional degree and could define the first three or four years of study as being at the undergraduate level, and the\nremaining year(s) of study as being at the graduate or professional level. A student may receive Direct Loans at the\napplicable undergraduate annual loan limits (as well as other Title IV aid at the undergraduate level) during the\nundergraduate portion of such a program, and then may receive Direct Loans at the graduate and professional student\nannual loan limit (and also Direct PLUS Loans) for the graduate and professional portion of the program.\nSee Volume 1 for more detailed guidance on student eligibility for Title IV aid in programs that combine undergraduate\nand graduate study, including programs that lead only to a graduate or professional degree, but admit students who do\nnot yet meet the regulatory requirements to be considered graduate or professional degree students.\nStudents Returning for a Second Baccalaureate Degree\nIf a student with a baccalaureate degree enrolls in another baccalaureate program, the student9s grade level for loan limit\npurposes would be based on the amount of work that the school counts toward satisfying the requirements of the new\nprogram. For instance, if your school accepts 30 semester hours of a student9s work in a previous baccalaureate program\ntoward the requirements for a BS in Chemistry at your school and, on that basis, classifies the student at the second-year\nlevel, then the student would be eligible for second-year undergraduate loan limits (see <Loan Limit When a\nBaccalaureate or Associate Degree Is Required for Admission to an Undergraduate Program= earlier in this chapter for the\nloan limit that applies when a student is required to have a prior associate or baccalaureate degree as a condition for\nbeing admitted to an undergraduate program).\nStudents Who Transfer From a Graduate Program to an Undergraduate Program During an Academic Year\nIf a student transfers from a graduate program to an undergraduate program in the middle of an academic year, the\nundergraduate annual loan limit for the student9s grade level applies but amounts previously borrowed at the graduate\nlevel within the same academic year do not count against the undergraduate annual loan limit. However, the total amount\nawarded for the academic year may not exceed the higher (graduate or professional) annual loan limit.\nVolume 8, Chapter 4, Example 1: Transfer From a Graduate to Undergraduate Program During the Same Academic\nYear\nA student who received $10,250 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds for a fall semester loan as a graduate student\nenrolls in an undergraduate program at the same school in the spring semester of the school9s fall-spring\nacademic year and is classified as a third-year independent undergraduate. As a third-year independent\nundergraduate, the student9s annual loan limit is $12,500, not more than $5,500 of which may be subsidized.', 'period are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be\nenrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and\nspring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be\nenrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering\nthe fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s\nCOA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a\nschool initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of\nat least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily\ndrops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not\nrequired to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school\nto adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and\nspring quarters only.\nIn the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-\nonly loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring\nloan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would\nthen be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining\nthe student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods\nOther Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a\nstudent9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs\nassociated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the\nfall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine\nmonths.\nThe limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last\nterms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period.\nFor instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall\nterm or the spring term.\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when\nperiods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\nMinimum Loan Periods\nThe minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar.\nAs explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a\nDirect Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on\nwhether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard\nor nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the\ncase of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below.\nNonstandard terms may be one of the following types:\n1. \nNonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any\nother term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length.\nSE9W\nPeriod of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition\n34 CFR 685.102(b)', 'counted toward the borrower9s aggregate Direct Loan limits.\nEffect of a Change in Student Status on Aggregate Loan Limits\nIn some cases, a student may qualify for higher loan limits but then lose eligibility for the higher limits due to a change in\nstatus. One such situation is when a dependent undergraduate qualifies for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts\nbecause the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, but in a subsequent academic year the student9s\nparent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan. In this circumstance the dependent student no longer qualifies for the additional\nunsubsidized loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. During any\nacademic year when a dependent student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student is subject to the\ndependent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student otherwise would have\nbeen eligible to receive under the dependent undergraduate annual loan limits are counted when determining the\nstudent9s remaining eligibility under the $31,000 combined subsidized and unsubsidized dependent undergraduate\naggregate limit (see Example 3 below).\nA similar situation occurs when a student who received loans for a graduate or professional degree program later returns\nto school and enrolls in an undergraduate program. The student is then subject to the undergraduate annual and\naggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student previously received as an undergraduate are counted when\ndetermining the student9s remaining eligibility under the undergraduate aggregate loan limit (see Example 2 earlier in this\nchapter).\nVolume 8, Chapter 4, Example 3: Aggregate Loan Limits and Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Amounts When\nParents Are Unable To Obtain Direct PLUS Loans\nA dependent student receives additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the additional amounts available\nto independent undergraduates) for the first three years of a four-year program because the student9s parent is\nunable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan for each of those years.\nFor each of the first three years, the student receives the maximum subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts\nunder the independent student annual loan limits (remember that the annual subsidized maximums are the same\nfor dependent and independent undergraduates):\nFirst Year (independent student loan\nlimit)\n$3,500\nsubsidized\n$6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent\nmaximum)\nSecond Year (independent student\nloan limit)\n$4,500\nsubsidized\n$6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent\nmaximum)\nThird Year (independent student loan\nlimit)\n$5,500\nsubsidized\n$7,000 unsubsidized ($5,000 more than dependent\nmaximum)\nTotal\n$13,500\nsubsidized\n$19,000 unsubsidized ($13,000 more than dependent\nmaximum)\nIn the fourth year, the parent is eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, so the student is then subject to the annual\nand aggregate loan limits for a dependent undergraduate. The dependent student received a total of $13,500 in\nDirect Subsidized Loan funds and $19,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds ($32,500 combined subsidized and\nunsubsidized total) for the first three years when the student9s parent was unable to obtain Direct PLUS Loans.\nThese are the same amounts that an independent student who qualified for the maximum annual loan limit each\nyear could have received. If the student9s parent had been able to receive Direct PLUS Loans during each of the\nfirst three years and the student received the maximum subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts under the', 'First Year\n$9,500\n$3,500\nSecond Year\n$10,500\n$4,500\nThird Year and Beyond\n$12,500\n$5,500\nCriteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Funds\nDependent students whose parents are unable to borrow Direct PLUS Loans due to adverse credit or other exceptional\ncircumstances may receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds up to the same amount that is available to\nindependent undergraduate students. Because Direct PLUS Loans can be made for up to the full COA minus other financial\nassistance received, the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount may not be sufficient to substitute entirely for the\namount a parent could receive under the Direct PLUS Loan program. Therefore, you should determine whether the\nparents may be able to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser who does not have an adverse credit history\nbefore originating additional unsubsidized loan amounts for the dependent student. Before a dependent student can\nreceive the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount, you must document the basis of the student9s eligibility. Some\nbasic guidelines for making this determination are discussed below. However, keep in mind that none of the following, by\nthemselves, are sufficient to make a dependent student eligible for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds:\nThe parent9s unwillingness to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan (even though the parent would otherwise be eligible to\nborrow);\nThe school9s decision not to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan program; or\nThe financial aid administrator9s belief that the parent should not borrow a Direct PLUS Loan.\nGeneral Guidelines for Determining That a Dependent Student May Receive Additional Unsubsidized Funds\nThe sections that follow provide general guidelines for making a determination that a dependent student is eligible to\nreceive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds under various circumstances.\nOnly One Parent Has Applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and Been Denied\nIf only one of a student9s parents has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and been denied based on adverse credit, you may\naward additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds on that basis, without first determining whether there is another parent\nwho could take out a Direct PLUS Loan. However, if both parents apply independently and one is approved and the other\ndenied, the dependent student is not eligible for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts.\nA Previously Approved Parent Later Requests Additional Direct PLUS Loan Funds and Is Denied\nThe dependent student may become eligible at any time during an academic year if a parent has first been approved and\nthen later denied a Direct PLUS Loan. For example, if a parent was approved for and received the full amount of a Direct\nPLUS Loan for a fall-spring loan period, but the parent is subsequently determined ineligible due to having an adverse\ncredit history when they request additional Direct PLUS Loan funds later during the spring semester, you may award\nIncreased Direct Unsubsidized Loan Eligibility for Independent Undergraduates and Certain\nDependent Undergraduates\n34 CFR 685.203(c)']","['Direct Loan Eligibility After an Enrollment Status Change If a student who received a disbursement of Direct Loan funds prior to the first day of classes of a payment period begins attendance on a less-than-half-time basis, there is no requirement for the school or the student to return the loan funds as long as: The student began attendance in at least one course during the payment period; and At the time of the loan disbursement the student was enrolled (registered) for classes on at least a half-time basis.

However, it is generally understood that if a student drops below half-time enrollment, it may affect their eligibility for federal student loans, including Direct Loans. Typically, students must maintain at least half-time enrollment to remain eligible for federal student aid, and dropping below this threshold could lead to the requirement to begin repayment on their loans.

For precise details regarding the implications of dropping to less-than-half-time status after receiving a Direct Loan, it would be advisable to consult the financial aid office at the student's institution or refer to the specific federal regulations governing student loans.","If a student who received a disbursement of Direct Loan funds begins attendance on a less-than-half-time basis, there is no requirement for the school or the student to return the loan funds as long as the student began attendance in at least one course during the payment period and was enrolled for classes on at least a half-time basis at the time of the loan disbursement.

If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default. Your school can also offer financial literacy classes, on a credit or non-credit basis, that include\ninformation on budgeting, debt management, anticipated earnings by profession, elements of loan counseling, etc.,\nthough eligibility for a Direct Loan cannot be contingent on completion of such a class.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrowers\nBelow we provide a summary of the information that must be covered in entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan\nand Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers. For more detailed information, refer to the regulations cited at the end of this\nsection.\nEntrance counseling for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loan borrowers must:\nExplain the use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN);\nEmphasize the importance of the loan repayment obligation;\nDescribe the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, delinquent debt collection procedures\nunder Federal law, and litigation;\nEmphasize that the borrower must repay the full amount of the loan even if the borrower does not complete the\nprogram, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain\nemployment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services\nthat the student paid for with the loan;\nInform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on a range of student levels of\nindebtedness depending on the types of loans the borrower has received, or based on the average indebtedness of\nother borrowers in the same program at the same school;\nExplain how accepting the loan will affect the borrower9s eligibility for other forms of student financial assistance;\nProvide information on how interest accrues and is capitalized during periods when the interest is not paid by either\nthe borrower or the Department;\nInform the borrower of the option to pay the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan while the borrower is in school;\nExplain the definition of half-time enrollment at the school and the consequences of not maintaining half-time\nenrollment;\nExplain the importance of contacting the appropriate offices at the school if the borrower withdraws before\nDirect Loan Entrance Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(a)\nLoan Counseling Requirements and Flexibilities\nDCL GEN-15-06', ""provided by those companies are already offered free of charge through the Department or the borrower's loan\nservicer;\nProvide a general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers (i.e. student loan\ninterest deduction); and\nRequire the borrower to provide current information concerning their name, address, Social Security number,\nreferences, and driver9s license number and state of issuance, as well as the borrower9s expected permanent\naddress, the address of their next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower9s expected employer, if known\n(see also <Providing Borrower Information at Separation= below).\nAs stated above, Direct Loan exit counseling must provide borrowers with the information the Department makes\navailable in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA. This section of the law requires the Department to make available\nto postsecondary schools and other entities a wide variety of information about federal student assistance programs,\nincluding information to help students assess the debt burden and repayment obligations that will be incurred as a result\nof receiving Title IV loans. As noted below under <Counseling Methods,= documentation that a borrower has completed the\nDepartment9s online exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan exit counseling requirements. Schools that choose to\nconduct their own exit counseling can meet the requirement to provide borrowers with the information made available by\nthe Department in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA by providing borrowers with a copy of the Department9s\nDirect Loan Exit Counseling Guide.\nProviding Borrower Information at Separation\nSchools that conduct their own exit counseling must provide the current personal information collected from the student\n(name, address, references, etc.) to students9 loan servicers within 60 days. Students authorize their school to release\ninformation to servicers in the loan promissory note they signed. No further permission is needed.\nStudents who complete online exit counseling on the Department9s StudentAid.gov website fulfill this requirement as part\nof the counseling session; NSLDS provides the information to the loan holders.\nCounseling Methods\nThe Department offers Direct Loan Program online entrance and exit counseling for students on the StudentAid.gov\nwebsite. Your school will receive notification through the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) (see <Required Electronic\nProcesses= in Volume 2, Chapter 3 for more information) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers, and\ncompletion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If your school documents that borrowers have\ncompleted the Department9s online counseling, it has satisfied its counseling responsibility. Documentation that a\nborrower has completed the Department9s online entrance or exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan entrance or exit\ncounseling requirements.\nYour school may also choose to provide entrance or exit counseling through an in-person session or (for entrance\ncounseling) by providing a separate written form to the student that the student signs and returns to the school. If your\nschool conducts in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions\ncan help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive\nprograms to ensure that students understand the terms and conditions of their loans. Counseling materials, such as the\nentrance and exit counseling guides, are available in the Financial Aid Toolkit.\nA school may adopt an alternative approach for entrance counseling as a part of its quality assurance plan. For more\ninformation, see the regulation cited below.\nRequired Content for Exit Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(b)(4)"", 'If your school participates in the Direct PLUS program but a student9s parent cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the\nstudent is allowed to borrow additional unsubsidized funds (see <Criteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan Funds= in Chapter 4 of this volume).\nRequired Counseling for Direct PLUS Loan Applicants With Adverse Credit\nAny student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has an adverse credit history but qualifies by obtaining an endorser\nor documenting that there are extenuating circumstances must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling on the\nDepartment9s StudentAid.gov website.\nAdverse Credit History and Default\nAlthough a default on a Title IV loan will generally appear in a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant9s credit record\nand result in the individual being determined to have an adverse credit history, being in default on a Title IV loan and\nhaving an adverse credit history are separate eligibility issues. A Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified through the\nDepartment9s National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as being in default on a Title IV loan and who has also been\ndetermined to have an adverse credit history (due to the default and/or other adverse credit conditions) cannot qualify for\na Direct PLUS Loan simply by obtaining an endorser or by providing acceptable documentation of extenuating\ncircumstances. The applicant must also separately resolve the default status by one of the means discussed under\n<Resolving Default Status= in Volume 1, Chapter 3.\nIn some cases, the Direct PLUS Loan credit check may not reveal a default on a Title IV loan, particularly if the default is\nnot recent. If a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified in NSLDS as being in default on a Title IV\nloan does not have any other adverse credit issues, the applicant will pass the PLUS credit check. In this circumstance you\ncannot assume that the approved credit check result supersedes the information in NSLDS. The default must be resolved\nbefore you can disburse Direct PLUS Loan funds or other Title IV aid to the applicant.\nDirect PLUS Loan Application\nSchools that offer Direct PLUS Loans have the option of requiring student and parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants to\ncomplete the Direct PLUS Loan Application (formally known as the ""Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request for Supplemental\nInformation"") on the Department\'s StudentAid.gov website as the first step in applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. The Direct\nPLUS Loan Application collects the requested loan amount, the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended, and\nother information related to processing the requested Direct PLUS Loan.\nUse of the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov is not required. Schools may choose to develop their own\nprocesses for obtaining the information needed to originate Direct PLUS Loans.\nAlthough the Department9s FAFSA Processing System (FPS) matches student Direct PLUS Loan applicants against NSLDS\nto determine if they are in default on a Title IV loan, it does not perform this match for parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants.\nHowever, the Department conducts an NSLDS default check on all Direct PLUS Loan applicants (both students and\nparents) who complete the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov.\nSchools that use the Direct PLUS Loan Application are notified of the result of the NSLDS default check through the\nCommon Origination and Disbursement (COD) System.

This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school responsibilities.']","Direct Loan borrowers, including those with adverse credit history, have specific counseling requirements that schools must adhere to. Here’s a comprehensive overview:

### Counseling Requirements for Direct Loan Borrowers

1. **Entrance Counseling**:
   - Required for all first-time student borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and student Direct PLUS Loans.
   - Must be completed before the first disbursement of the loan.
   - Schools can provide this counseling through various methods, including in-person sessions, online platforms, or written materials. If conducted online, schools must ensure that students complete the counseling, which may include a test to assess understanding.
   - The counseling must cover essential topics such as the loan repayment obligation, consequences of default, interest accrual, and the importance of maintaining half-time enrollment.

2. **Exit Counseling**:
   - Required for all Direct Loan borrowers shortly before they cease to be enrolled at least half-time.
   - Schools can conduct exit counseling in person or provide written materials via mail or email. If conducted online through the Department’s website, it fulfills all requirements.
   - Schools must collect and provide updated personal information from borrowers to their loan servicers within 60 days after exit counseling.

3. **Special Counseling for PLUS Loan Borrowers with Adverse Credit**:
   - Any student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant identified with an adverse credit history must complete additional PLUS Loan Credit Counseling if they qualify for the loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting extenuating circumstances.
   - This counseling is separate from the standard entrance counseling required for first-time graduate and professional student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.

### Responsibilities of Schools

- **Documentation**: Schools must document that students have completed both entrance and exit counseling.
- **Availability of Expertise**: Schools must ensure that an individual with expertise in Title IV programs is available to answer students' questions shortly after counseling sessions.
- **Providing Information**: Schools can take additional steps to assist students, such as helping them develop budgets and understanding repayment options.
- **Compliance with Regulations**: Schools must adhere to the specific content requirements for both entrance and exit counseling as outlined in the regulations, ensuring that all necessary information is conveyed to borrowers.

In summary, schools play a crucial role in facilitating the counseling process for Direct Loan borrowers, ensuring compliance with federal regulations, and providing necessary support to help students understand their borrowing responsibilities.","First-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a Direct Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis.

"How do exceptions to the normal loan period apply to Direct PLUS Loans when clinical work is involved, and what are the implications if a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passes away?","['may not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of\npayments while the student was enrolled at least half time.\nIf a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death,\nthe school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of\nthe original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent\nstudent (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4\nof this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate\na Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended.\nFor additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the\nFSA Handbook.\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term\nVolume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and\nnonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine\nweeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education\nprogram work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical\nWork in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below.\nIf clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard\nterm, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.\nIf a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the\nstarting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of\nthe clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on\nAugust 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not\nbegin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be\nthe beginning date of the term.\nIf the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a\nDirect Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the\ncase).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the\nspring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as\nSeptember 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which\nit is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term.\nIf loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the\nnormal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies,\nand the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of\na fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that\nfall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1\nthrough June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1\nthrough June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for\ninformation on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits).\nIf there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work,\nand the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to\nbegin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two\nloan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.', 'hour, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is offered in modules, the minimum loan period is still the lesser of the\nacademic year or the program length (or remaining portion of the program).\nFor Title IV aid purposes, students are allowed to skip one or more modules. However, if a loan period includes modules\nthat the student does not attend, the COA for the loan period may not include costs associated with those modules.\nMinimum Loan Period: Standard Term Combined With an Intersession\nAs we explain under <Intersessions= in Volume 3, Chapter 1, in limited cases for academic programs offered in standard\nterms, a short nonstandard term (often called an <intersession=) may be combined with a preceding or following standard\nterm and considered to be a single standard term. In such cases, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is different\ndepending on whether a student attends the intersession. If a student who attends the intersession requests a loan for the\ncombined term, the loan period includes the standard term plus the intersession. However, if the student attends only the\nstandard term and is not enrolled in the intersession that is attached to that term, the loan period includes only the\nstandard term.\nMaximum Loan Periods\nThe maximum period for which you may originate a Direct Loan is generally an academic year. However, if your school\napplies the annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans to a period of time greater than\nan academic year, you may originate a Direct Loan for that longer period of time. For example, a school might offer an\n1100 clock-hour program and define the academic year as 900 clock hours but could choose to allow students to receive\njust one annual loan limit for the entire 1100-hour program. In that case, the loan period would correspond to the length\nof the program, a period of time that is longer than the academic year.\nDirect Loan Disbursement Requirements\nFor general guidance on the timing of disbursements made under the Title IV programs, see Volume 3, Chapter 1. For\nguidance on reporting Title IV program disbursements through the COD System and the rules for making early\ndisbursements, late disbursements, and retroactive payments, see Volume 4, Chapter 2. In this section we discuss certain\nother disbursement requirements that are specific to the Direct Loan Program.\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal Direct Loan disbursement\nrequirements that apply when periods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\nRequirement for Substantially Equal Disbursements\nDirect Loans must be disbursed in substantially equal installments, regardless of any difference in costs for different\npayment periods that are within the same loan period, and no Direct Loan disbursement may exceed one-half of the loan\nMaximum Loan Period\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(10)(iv)\nDetermining Direct Loan Disbursement Dates and Amounts\n34 CFR 685.303(d)', 'period are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be\nenrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and\nspring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be\nenrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering\nthe fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s\nCOA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a\nschool initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of\nat least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily\ndrops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not\nrequired to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school\nto adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and\nspring quarters only.\nIn the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-\nonly loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring\nloan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would\nthen be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining\nthe student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods\nOther Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a\nstudent9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs\nassociated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the\nfall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine\nmonths.\nThe limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last\nterms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period.\nFor instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall\nterm or the spring term.\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when\nperiods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\nMinimum Loan Periods\nThe minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar.\nAs explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a\nDirect Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on\nwhether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard\nor nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the\ncase of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below.\nNonstandard terms may be one of the following types:\n1. \nNonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any\nother term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length.\nSE9W\nPeriod of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition\n34 CFR 685.102(b)', 'Chapter 2\nDirect Loan Counseling\nCounseling Overview\nFirst-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a\nDirect Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled\non at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'If a loan period includes more than one standard or SE9W nonstandard term, the second or subsequent disbursement\nof a Direct Loan disbursement normally can be made up to 10 days before the first day of classes of the second or\nsubsequent term. However, if a second or subsequent term in a loan period includes clinical work that a student has\nnot yet started when the term begins (because the clinical work associated with that term does not start until some\npoint after the beginning date of the term), the second or subsequent loan disbursement can be made no earlier\nthan 10 days before the beginning of the clinical work. (Note: The scenario described here assumes that the term\nincludes only clinical work. If, in addition to the clinical work that starts later, the term also includes regular\ncoursework that starts on the beginning date of the term, the normal early disbursement rules apply and the second\nor subsequent disbursement can be made up to 10 days before the first day of classes of the term.)']","['<1-hop>\n\nmay not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of payments while the student was enrolled at least half time. If a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death, the school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent student (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4 of this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.', '<2-hop>\n\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and nonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","Exceptions to the normal loan period for Direct PLUS Loans apply in specific circumstances involving clinical work. If a standard term or a substantially equal nonstandard term (SE9W) includes clinical work that meets certain criteria, the loan period can be adjusted. For instance, if clinical work begins before the term starts, the loan period's start date is set to the beginning of the clinical work rather than the term's start date. Conversely, if the clinical work ends after the term's end date, the loan period's end date is adjusted to the end of the clinical work.

For example, if a fall semester runs from September 1 to December 31, but clinical work starts on August 15, the loan period would be reported as August 15 to December 31. Similarly, if clinical work associated with a spring semester ends on June 20, the loan period would be reported as September 1 to June 20.

Regarding the implications of a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passing away, if the school must return funds disbursed after the parent's death, they should check if there is a surviving parent who can take out a new Direct PLUS Loan for the amount that needs to be returned. If no surviving parent is available, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has technically ended. This allows for continued financial support for the student despite the parent's passing.

In summary, clinical work can lead to exceptions in loan periods for Direct PLUS Loans, and there are provisions for handling the situation if a parent borrower dies, ensuring that students can still access necessary funds.","Exceptions to the normal loan period apply to Direct PLUS Loans when clinical work is involved by allowing the loan period start date to be the beginning date of the clinical work if it starts before the term, and the loan period end date to be the ending date of the clinical work if it ends after the term. This adjustment ensures that the loan period accurately reflects the duration of the clinical work. In the event that a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passes away, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended. This ensures that the student can continue to receive financial aid despite the change in circumstances.",0.8,1.0,0.83,0.9334617368946772,0.4285714279591837,0.25,9.030761957168579,bm25_rag
"What are the requirements for entrance counseling for first-time Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers, and how does this relate to the overall Direct Loan counseling process?","['Chapter 2\nDirect Loan Counseling\nCounseling Overview\nFirst-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a\nDirect Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled\non at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'Regardless of the counseling methods your school uses, it must document that the student received entrance and exit\ncounseling, and it must ensure that an individual with expertise in the Title IV programs is reasonably available shortly\nafter the counseling to answer the student9s questions.\nCounseling for Correspondence and Study Abroad Students\nIf a first-time student borrower has enrolled in a study-abroad program (approved by a U.S. school for credit) or a\ncorrespondence or distance learning program, the school must document that the student has completed online entrance\ncounseling that meets the regulatory Direct Loan entrance counseling requirements or provide written entrance\ncounseling information by mail or email before making the first disbursement of a Direct Loan to the student.\nIn the case of exit counseling for correspondence programs or study abroad programs, the school may mail or email the\nborrower written counseling materials within 30 days after the borrower completes the program, with a request that they\nprovide the contact and personal information that would ordinarily have been collected through the counseling process.\nProviding Additional Information\nYour school can take additional steps to counsel students, such as assisting them with developing a budget, estimating\nneed for loans, and planning for repayment. You can also reinforce messages to borrowers. For example, with each\ndisbursement you can remind students about the importance of maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP; see\nVolume 1, Chapter 1 for details on SAP requirements), planning for future employment, and staying in touch with the loan\nservicer. Sample measures for loan counseling are given in the <Sample Default Prevention Plan= that can be found in the\nregulations cited below.\nPLUS Loan Credit Counseling\nSpecial loan counseling is required for any student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has been determined to\nhave an adverse credit history, but who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan either by getting a loan endorser or by\ndocumenting to the satisfaction of the Department that there are extenuating circumstances related to the adverse\ncredit. While the special PLUS Loan Credit Counseling is mandatory only for these borrowers, any PLUS borrower can\nvoluntarily complete this counseling. See Chapter 1 of this volume for more information about adverse credit.\nNote that the special counseling described above is separate from the entrance counseling that all first-time graduate and\nprofessional student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers must complete, as described earlier in this chapter.\nAnnual Student Loan Acknowledgement\nThe Department offers a tool on the StudentAid.gov website called the Annual Student Loan Acknowledgement.

Your school can also offer financial literacy classes, on a credit or non-credit basis, that include\ninformation on budgeting, debt management, anticipated earnings by profession, elements of loan counseling, etc.,\nthough eligibility for a Direct Loan cannot be contingent on completion of such a class.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrowers\nBelow we provide a summary of the information that must be covered in entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan\nand Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers. For more detailed information, refer to the regulations cited at the end of this\nsection.\nEntrance counseling for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loan borrowers must:\nExplain the use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN);\nEmphasize the importance of the loan repayment obligation;\nDescribe the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, delinquent debt collection procedures\nunder Federal law, and litigation;\nEmphasize that the borrower must repay the full amount of the loan even if the borrower does not complete the\nprogram, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain\nemployment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services\nthat the student paid for with the loan;\nInform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on a range of student levels of\nindebtedness depending on the types of loans the borrower has received, or based on the average indebtedness of\nother borrowers in the same program at the same school;\nExplain how accepting the loan will affect the borrower9s eligibility for other forms of student financial assistance;\nProvide information on how interest accrues and is capitalized during periods when the interest is not paid by either\nthe borrower or the Department;\nInform the borrower of the option to pay the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan while the borrower is in school;\nExplain the definition of half-time enrollment at the school and the consequences of not maintaining half-time\nenrollment;\nExplain the importance of contacting the appropriate offices at the school if the borrower withdraws before\nDirect Loan Entrance Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(a)\nLoan Counseling Requirements and Flexibilities\nDCL GEN-15-06', ""provided by those companies are already offered free of charge through the Department or the borrower's loan\nservicer;\nProvide a general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers (i.e. student loan\ninterest deduction); and\nRequire the borrower to provide current information concerning their name, address, Social Security number,\nreferences, and driver9s license number and state of issuance, as well as the borrower9s expected permanent\naddress, the address of their next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower9s expected employer, if known\n(see also <Providing Borrower Information at Separation= below).\nAs stated above, Direct Loan exit counseling must provide borrowers with the information the Department makes\navailable in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA. This section of the law requires the Department to make available\nto postsecondary schools and other entities a wide variety of information about federal student assistance programs,\nincluding information to help students assess the debt burden and repayment obligations that will be incurred as a result\nof receiving Title IV loans. As noted below under <Counseling Methods,= documentation that a borrower has completed the\nDepartment9s online exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan exit counseling requirements. Schools that choose to\nconduct their own exit counseling can meet the requirement to provide borrowers with the information made available by\nthe Department in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA by providing borrowers with a copy of the Department9s\nDirect Loan Exit Counseling Guide.\nProviding Borrower Information at Separation\nSchools that conduct their own exit counseling must provide the current personal information collected from the student\n(name, address, references, etc.) to students9 loan servicers within 60 days. Students authorize their school to release\ninformation to servicers in the loan promissory note they signed. No further permission is needed.\nStudents who complete online exit counseling on the Department9s StudentAid.gov website fulfill this requirement as part\nof the counseling session; NSLDS provides the information to the loan holders.\nCounseling Methods\nThe Department offers Direct Loan Program online entrance and exit counseling for students on the StudentAid.gov\nwebsite. Your school will receive notification through the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) (see <Required Electronic\nProcesses= in Volume 2, Chapter 3 for more information) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers, and\ncompletion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If your school documents that borrowers have\ncompleted the Department9s online counseling, it has satisfied its counseling responsibility. Documentation that a\nborrower has completed the Department9s online entrance or exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan entrance or exit\ncounseling requirements.\nYour school may also choose to provide entrance or exit counseling through an in-person session or (for entrance\ncounseling) by providing a separate written form to the student that the student signs and returns to the school. If your\nschool conducts in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions\ncan help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive\nprograms to ensure that students understand the terms and conditions of their loans. Counseling materials, such as the\nentrance and exit counseling guides, are available in the Financial Aid Toolkit.\nA school may adopt an alternative approach for entrance counseling as a part of its quality assurance plan. For more\ninformation, see the regulation cited below.\nRequired Content for Exit Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(b)(4)"", 'Refusing To Originate a Loan or Originating for Less Than a Borrower9s Maximum Eligibility\nOn a case-by-case basis, you may refuse to originate a Direct Loan for an individual borrower, or you may originate a loan\nfor an amount less than the borrower9s maximum eligibility. If you choose to exercise this discretion, you must ensure\nthat your decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and do not constitute a pattern or practice that denies access to\nDirect Loans for borrowers because of race, sex, color, income, religion, national origin, age, or disability status. When you\nmake a decision not to originate a loan or to reduce the amount of the loan, you must retain documentation supporting\nthe determination in the student9s file and provide the reason for the determination to the student in writing. Also note\nthat your school may not have a policy of limiting Direct Loan borrowing on an across-the-board or categorical basis. For\nexample, you may not have a policy of limiting borrowing to the amount needed to cover the school charges, or not\nallowing otherwise eligible students to receive up to the full combined annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans.\nProhibition on Establishing Additional Eligibility Requirements for Direct Loans\nYou may not condition the disbursement of a Direct Loan on anything other than the eligibility criteria under the federal\nregulations that govern the Direct Loan Program. For example, you may not:\nRequire students to participate in counseling beyond the required entrance counseling for first-time student\nborrowers (see Chapter 2 of this volume for more information) as a condition for receiving a Direct Loan;\nRequire a student to complete a separate Direct Loan application as a condition for receiving a Direct Loan; or\nPerform credit checks on students in connection with awarding Direct Loans or other Title IV aid.\nDepartment of Education Office of the Inspector General Hotline Portal\n1-800-MIS-USED (1-800-647-8733)\nRefusing to Originate a Loan\nHEA Sec. 479(A)(e)\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(8)\nDCL GEN-11-07\nProhibition on Requiring an Additional Application\nMarch 18, 2014 Electronic Announcement']","['<1-hop>\n\nChapter 2 Direct Loan Counseling Counseling Overview First-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a Direct Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers who meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit history. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school responsibilities.', '<2-hop>\n\nEntrance Counseling Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. For this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student who requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before the authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan to a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling. Entrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are about to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person counseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. If entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable steps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the terms and conditions of the loan.

As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance education, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed. You may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance counseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements are reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that unreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling can include one or more of the following: Extra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods; A requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though you cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan); A requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or A requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.']","For first-time Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers, entrance counseling is a mandatory requirement before they can receive their first disbursement of the loan. This requirement also applies to borrowers of Direct Unsubsidized Loans and student Direct PLUS Loans, but not to parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. A first-time borrower is defined as someone who has not previously received any Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan.

### Requirements for Entrance Counseling:
1. **Content Coverage**: The entrance counseling must cover several key topics, including:
   - The use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN).
   - The importance of the loan repayment obligation.
   - Consequences of default, including adverse credit reports and collection procedures.
   - The borrower's obligation to repay the full loan amount regardless of their educational outcomes.
   - Sample monthly repayment amounts based on different levels of indebtedness.
   - How accepting the loan affects eligibility for other financial aid.
   - Information on interest accrual and capitalization.
   - The definition of half-time enrollment and its implications.
   - Importance of contacting the school if the borrower withdraws from their program.

2. **Delivery Methods**: Counseling can be conducted in various formats:
   - In-person sessions.
   - Written forms that the borrower signs and returns.
   - Online or interactive electronic means, with a requirement for the borrower to acknowledge receipt of the information.

3. **Completion Verification**: Schools must ensure that students complete the counseling, which may include a test to assess their understanding of the loan terms. Schools must also have someone available to answer questions after the counseling session.

4. **Documentation**: Schools are required to document that the student has completed the entrance counseling.

### Relation to Overall Direct Loan Counseling Process:
Entrance counseling is part of a broader Direct Loan counseling process that includes exit counseling, which is required for all Direct Loan borrowers before they cease enrollment at least half-time. The counseling process aims to ensure that borrowers are well-informed about their loans, repayment responsibilities, and the implications of borrowing. Schools may also provide additional financial literacy resources, but they cannot require participation in these beyond the mandated entrance counseling.

In summary, entrance counseling is a critical step for first-time borrowers to understand their loan obligations and is part of a comprehensive counseling framework designed to support students throughout their borrowing experience.","Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers. This counseling provides comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan and the borrower's responsibility to repay it. It can be conducted in-person, through written forms, or online, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. Schools must ensure that students complete the counseling, which may include a test of their understanding. This requirement is part of the broader Direct Loan counseling process, which also includes exit counseling for all student Direct Loan borrowers before they cease to be enrolled at least half-time. The overall process ensures that borrowers are informed about their loans and responsibilities, aligning with the school's responsibilities to guide students through their financial aid options.",1.0,1.0,0.57,0.9592861854206531,0.5999999988,,11.84746789932251,bm25_rag
How do student loan eligibility criteria and minimum loan periods interact when a student is ineligible for a term within a fall-winter-spring academic year?,"['period are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be\nenrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and\nspring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be\nenrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering\nthe fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s\nCOA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a\nschool initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of\nat least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily\ndrops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not\nrequired to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school\nto adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and\nspring quarters only.\nIn the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-\nonly loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring\nloan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would\nthen be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining\nthe student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods\nOther Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a\nstudent9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs\nassociated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the\nfall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine\nmonths.\nThe limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last\nterms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period.\nFor instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall\nterm or the spring term.\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when\nperiods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\nMinimum Loan Periods\nThe minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar.\nAs explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a\nDirect Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on\nwhether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard\nor nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the\ncase of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below.\nNonstandard terms may be one of the following types:\n1. \nNonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any\nother term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length.\nSE9W\nPeriod of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition\n34 CFR 685.102(b)', 'hour, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is offered in modules, the minimum loan period is still the lesser of the\nacademic year or the program length (or remaining portion of the program).\nFor Title IV aid purposes, students are allowed to skip one or more modules. However, if a loan period includes modules\nthat the student does not attend, the COA for the loan period may not include costs associated with those modules.\nMinimum Loan Period: Standard Term Combined With an Intersession\nAs we explain under <Intersessions= in Volume 3, Chapter 1, in limited cases for academic programs offered in standard\nterms, a short nonstandard term (often called an <intersession=) may be combined with a preceding or following standard\nterm and considered to be a single standard term. In such cases, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is different\ndepending on whether a student attends the intersession. If a student who attends the intersession requests a loan for the\ncombined term, the loan period includes the standard term plus the intersession. However, if the student attends only the\nstandard term and is not enrolled in the intersession that is attached to that term, the loan period includes only the\nstandard term.\nMaximum Loan Periods\nThe maximum period for which you may originate a Direct Loan is generally an academic year. However, if your school\napplies the annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans to a period of time greater than\nan academic year, you may originate a Direct Loan for that longer period of time. For example, a school might offer an\n1100 clock-hour program and define the academic year as 900 clock hours but could choose to allow students to receive\njust one annual loan limit for the entire 1100-hour program. In that case, the loan period would correspond to the length\nof the program, a period of time that is longer than the academic year.\nDirect Loan Disbursement Requirements\nFor general guidance on the timing of disbursements made under the Title IV programs, see Volume 3, Chapter 1. For\nguidance on reporting Title IV program disbursements through the COD System and the rules for making early\ndisbursements, late disbursements, and retroactive payments, see Volume 4, Chapter 2. In this section we discuss certain\nother disbursement requirements that are specific to the Direct Loan Program.\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal Direct Loan disbursement\nrequirements that apply when periods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\nRequirement for Substantially Equal Disbursements\nDirect Loans must be disbursed in substantially equal installments, regardless of any difference in costs for different\npayment periods that are within the same loan period, and no Direct Loan disbursement may exceed one-half of the loan\nMaximum Loan Period\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(10)(iv)\nDetermining Direct Loan Disbursement Dates and Amounts\n34 CFR 685.303(d)', '2. \nNonstandard terms that are substantially equal, but one or more of the terms in the academic year\ncontains fewer than nine weeks.\nNon-\nSE9W\n3. \nNonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length (one or more of the terms in the academic\nyear differs in length from another term by more than two weeks).\nNon-\nSE9W\nWe refer to the first type of nonstandard term as <SE9W= nonstandard terms. We group the second and third types\ntogether and refer to them as <non-SE9W= nonstandard terms.\nPrograms with SE9W nonstandard terms are treated the same as standard-term programs for purposes of determining\nminimum loan period length and monitoring annual loan limits. However, programs with non-SE9W nonstandard terms are\ntreated the same as non-term programs for these purposes.\nNote that substantially equal nonstandard terms (the first two types of nonstandard terms described above) are treated\ndifferently for purposes of determining Direct Loan payment periods than for determining minimum loan period length\nand monitoring annual loan limits. As explained in Volume 1, Chapter 1, if a program is offered in standard terms or in\nnonstandard terms that are substantially equal in length (regardless of the length of the nonstandard term), the payment\nperiod is the term.\nHowever, for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and monitoring Direct Loan annual loan\nlimits, substantially equal nonstandard terms that contain fewer than nine weeks are treated the same as nonstandard\nterms that are not substantially equal. This means that if a program has substantially equal nonstandard terms that are\nless than nine weeks in length, you must make a Direct Loan disbursement each term (the same as would be the case if\nthe program were offered in standard terms), but the minimum loan period and the type of academic year used to\nmonitor Direct Loan annual loan limits must be determined in accordance with the rules that apply to non-term programs.\nFor detailed information on standard term, nonstandard term, and non-term programs, see Volume 1, Chapter 1.\nMinimum Loan Period: Standard Term and SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\nFor credit-hour programs with standard terms (semesters, quarters, or trimesters), or with SE9W\nnonstandard terms, the minimum loan period is a single academic term. For example, if a student will be enrolled in the\nfall semester only and will skip the spring semester, you may originate a loan with a loan period that covers only the fall\nterm.\nMinimum Loan Period: Clock-Hour, Non-Term, and Non-SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\nFor all other programs (i.e., clock-hour, non-term, and non-SE9W nonstandard term programs), the minimum\nloan period is generally the lesser of the program length (or remainder of the program, if there is less than full academic\nyear remaining) or the academic year. There are exceptions to this minimum loan period rule when originating loans for\ntransfer students, or for students who complete or otherwise cease enrollment in one program and then begin a different\nprogram at the same school. We discuss these exceptions in detail in Chapter 7 of this volume.\nMinimum Loan Period: Programs Offered in Modules\nIf a program is offered in modules, this does not change the minimum loan period rules for Direct Loans. For example, if a\nstandard or SE9W nonstandard term is divided into two or more modules, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is\nstill the term, even if the student does not attend all modules within the term. Similarly, if a clock-hour, non-term credit-\nMinimum Loan Period\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(10)(i)', 'may not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of\npayments while the student was enrolled at least half time.\nIf a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death,\nthe school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of\nthe original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent\nstudent (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4\nof this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate\na Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended.\nFor additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the\nFSA Handbook.\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term\nVolume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and\nnonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine\nweeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education\nprogram work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical\nWork in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below.\nIf clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard\nterm, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.\nIf a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the\nstarting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of\nthe clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on\nAugust 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not\nbegin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be\nthe beginning date of the term.\nIf the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a\nDirect Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the\ncase).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the\nspring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as\nSeptember 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which\nit is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term.\nIf loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the\nnormal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies,\nand the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of\na fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that\nfall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1\nthrough June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1\nthrough June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for\ninformation on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits).\nIf there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work,\nand the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to\nbegin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two\nloan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.', 'COA (see Volume 3, Chapter 3);\nFor parents receiving a Direct PLUS Loan, ensure that the student has completed a FAFSA form (review the student9s\nISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary); and\nEnsure that the loan disbursement dates meet cash management and disbursement requirements.\nFor a Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loan, you must also:\nDetermine the student9s Pell Grant eligibility and, if they are eligible, include the grant in the student9s aid package;\nFor a Direct Unsubsidized Loan made to an undergraduate student, first determine the student9s eligibility for a\nDirect Subsidized Loan and, if the student is eligible, include the Direct Subsidized Loan in the student9s aid package;\nEnsure that the amount of the loan will not exceed the student9s annual or aggregate loan limits; and\nProrate the annual loan limit for an undergraduate enrolled in a program or remaining period of study that is shorter\nthan an academic year (as described in Chapter 5 of this volume).\nNo Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods Other Than Nine Months\nIf you originate a Direct Loan for a period shorter than a full academic year (for example, a loan for a single term or for a\nprogram shorter than an academic year), the loan amount must be based on the reduced costs for that shorter period of\nenrollment rather than the costs for the full academic year. However, as explained in Volume 3, Chapter 3, there are no\nalternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months comparable to the alternate EFCs for periods other than\nnine months that were used prior to the 2024-2025 award year. In all cases you must use the student9s full calculated 9-\nmonth SAI in the formula to determine financial need for Direct Subsidized Loans and other need-based aid even though\nthe COA will reflect the reduced costs for the shorter loan period. This means that students enrolled for periods shorter\nthan nine months will have less financial need than would have been the case in the past when using a smaller alternate\nEFC, because now the full calculated SAI must be subtracted from the reduced COA for the shorter period of enrollment\nwhen determining financial need for purposes of Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility.\nVolume 8, Chapter 3, Example 1: Effect of No Alternate SAI on Financial Need When Originating Loans for Periods\nLess Than Nine Months\nA first-year dependent student has a COA of $10,800 for an academic year consisting of the fall and spring\nsemesters and an SAI of 8,000, so the student9s financial need for the fall-spring enrollment period is $2,800 (see\nVolume 3, Chapter 3 for guidance on determining financial need). The student is not eligible for a Pell Grant and\nreceives no Title IV aid except for Direct Loans. The student qualifies for a $2,800 Direct Subsidized Loan to fully\ncover their financial need. (The student could also receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, but for purposes of this\nexample we cover only Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility.)\nThe student will also be enrolled for the summer term, which the school treats as a <trailer= to the preceding fall-\nspring Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) for purposes of monitoring annual loan limits (see Chapter 6 of this\nVolume). The summer term is four months in length and the COA for that term is $4,000. For students who attend\nthe summer term and request Direct Loan funds, the school9s normal practice is to originate a separate loan for\nthe summer term only. Because there is no alternate SAI for periods of enrollment less than nine months and the\nstudent9s SAI of 8,000 is greater than the summer term COA, the student has no financial need for summer and is\ntherefore ineligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan for that term (but could receive a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan).\nAs an alternative to originating a separate summer-only loan, the school could choose to originate a single loan\nfor a loan period covering the fall-spring SAY plus the summer trailer term. The student9s COA for that period of\nenrollment is $14,800. Subtracting the student9s SAI of 8,000 from the COA results in financial need of $6,800.\nThe student would therefore be eligible to receive a $3,500 Direct Subsidized Loan (the maximum subsidized\nannual loan limit for a dependent first-year student) for the fall-spring-summer loan period.']","['<1-hop>\n\nperiod are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and spring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be enrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering the fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s COA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a school initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of at least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily drops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not required to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school to adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and spring quarters only. In the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring- only loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring loan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would then be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining the student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods Other Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a student9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs associated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the fall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months. The limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last terms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period. For instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall term or the spring term. Note: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when periods of clinical work are included in a standard term.', '<2-hop>\n\nMinimum Loan Periods The minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar. As explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on whether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard or nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the case of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below. Nonstandard terms may be one of the following types: 1. Nonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any other term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length. SE9W Period of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition 34 CFR 685.102(b)']","When a student is ineligible for a term within a fall-winter-spring academic year, the interaction between student loan eligibility criteria and minimum loan periods is nuanced. 

1. **Loan Period Origination**: If a student is expected to be enrolled at least half-time in the fall and spring quarters but plans to skip the winter quarter or enroll less than half-time during that term, the school can still originate a loan for the entire fall-winter-spring period. However, the costs associated with the winter quarter cannot be included in the student's Cost of Attendance (COA) when determining the loan amount for the fall and spring quarters.

2. **Subsequent Changes in Enrollment**: If a school initially originates a loan based on the student's anticipated enrollment status of at least half-time for all three quarters, and the student later does not attend the winter quarter or drops below half-time status, the school is not required to change the original loan period. However, it may need to adjust the loan amount based on the reduced costs for the fall and spring quarters only.

3. **Separate Loan Options**: The school has the option to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-only periods if the student is ineligible for the winter term. In this case, the school must subtract the student's full Student Aid Index (SAI) from the costs of each term to determine eligibility for Direct Subsidized Loans. This could significantly reduce or eliminate the student's need for such loans.

4. **Minimum Loan Periods**: The minimum loan period for Direct Loans varies based on the academic calendar. For standard term programs, the minimum loan period is typically a single academic term. If a student skips a term, the school can originate a loan for just the term the student is attending, provided the student meets the eligibility criteria for that term.

5. **Eligibility Criteria**: Importantly, the eligibility for Direct Loans is contingent on the student being eligible during the first and last terms of the loan period. If the student is ineligible for either the fall or spring term, the school cannot originate a loan for that fall-winter-spring period.

In summary, while a student can still receive loans for the fall and spring quarters despite being ineligible for the winter quarter, the school must carefully consider the COA and the student's SAI when determining loan amounts and eligibility.","Student loan eligibility criteria allow a school to originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring period even if a student is ineligible for one of the terms, such as the winter quarter, provided the student is eligible during the first and last terms of the loan period. However, no costs associated with the ineligible term can be included in the student's Cost of Attendance (COA) when determining the loan amount. The minimum loan period for originating a Direct Loan depends on the school's academic calendar and whether the program is term-based or non-term. For term-based programs with nonstandard terms, the terms must be substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length. This interaction ensures that while students can receive loans for eligible terms, the loan amounts must be adjusted to reflect only the periods of eligibility, adhering to the minimum loan period requirements.",1.0,1.0,0.67,0.0,0.29999999969999996,0.4,12.19551396369934,bm25_rag
"How does proration apply to students in clock-hour programs when their remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year, and what are some examples of this proration process?","['Chapter 5\nLoan Limit Proration\nProration Overview\nThe annual maximum loan amount an undergraduate student may receive must be prorated (reduced) when the borrower\nis:\nEnrolled in a program that is shorter than a full academic year; or\nEnrolled in a program that is one academic year or more in length but is in a remaining period of study (a period of\nstudy at the end of which a student will have completed all requirements of the program) that is shorter than a full\nacademic year.\nWith one exception (see ""Proration of the Annual Loan Limit for Students who Graduate Early From Clock-Hour Programs""\nlater in this chapter), the annual loan limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are prorated only\nin these two situations. Loan limits are not prorated based on a student9s enrollment status, such as when a student is\nenrolled less than full time, or when a student is enrolled for a period of less than a full academic year that is not a\nremaining period of study.\nThe annual loan limit for Direct Unsubsidized Loans is not prorated for students enrolled in graduate or professional level\nprograms. Loan proration requirements also do not apply to students taking preparatory coursework or coursework\nnecessary for teacher certification. This is because the annual loan limit must be prorated only when a student is enrolled\nin a program or remaining portion of a program that is shorter than an academic year. Students taking preparatory\ncoursework or teacher certification coursework are not considered to be enrolled in a program for purposes of awarding\nTitle IV aid.\nIt9s important to understand that loan limit proration determines the maximum loan amount that a student may borrow\nfor a program or remaining balance of a program, not the actual loan amount a student is eligible to receive. In some\ncases, the loan amount a student is eligible to receive (based on costs, SAI, and OFA) may be less than the prorated loan\nlimit.\nUse of Fractions vs. Decimals When Prorating Loan Limits\nAs we explain in more detail below, proration involves multiplying the annual loan limit by a fraction. You may choose to\nconvert the fraction to a decimal and then multiply the annual loan limit by the decimal, but this conversion is not a\nrequirement. However, you should be consistent in the method you use, since the fraction and decimal calculations\nsometimes result in slightly different prorated loan limits, as shown in the examples later in the chapter.\nUsing the School9s Academic Year Definition If Longer Than the Title IV Minimum\nAs explained above, proration of the annual loan limit is required when an undergraduate student is enrolled in a program\nthat is shorter than an academic year or is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year.\nA school may choose to define its academic year as longer in weeks or hours than the minimum statutory requirements. If\nso, the school9s standard 3 not the statutory minimum 3 determines whether a program or a final period of study is shorter\nthan an academic year.\nSeparate Calculations for the Combined Subsidized and Unsubsidized Annual Loan Limit and the Maximum Subsidized\nLoan Limit Proration\n34 CFR 685.203(a), (b), (c)', 'Graduate Early From a Clock-Hour Program= later in this chapter).\nIn a standard-term program, or a credit-hour program using SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of\nstudy is considered shorter than an academic year if the remaining period contains fewer terms than the number of terms\ncovered by the school9s Title IV academic year. For programs that are offered in a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY; see\nChapter 6), the number of terms covered in the school9s Title IV academic year usually does not include a summer\n<header= or <trailer= term.\nConsider a student who is enrolled in a four-year program that is offered in an SAY consisting of three quarters plus a\nsummer trailer, and who has completed four academic years of study. The student needs to attend an additional quarter\nterm to complete the program requirements. The final quarter term falls in a new academic year; therefore the annual\nloan limit must be prorated because the remaining period of study (a single quarter) is less than a full academic year.\nSimilarly, if a student enrolled in a two-year program not offered in an SAY (where the Title IV academic year covers two\n15-week semesters) has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to\ncomplete the program requirements, the loan limit must be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester.\nNote that for standard-term programs or credit-hour programs with SE9W nonstandard terms, the length of the loan\nperiod does not determine whether a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic\nyear. The determining factor is the length of the remaining period of study in which the student is enrolled, which may not\nbe the same as the loan period. For example, if an undergraduate student is enrolled for a full SAY consisting of fall and\nspring semesters, and will complete the program at the end of the spring term, but is enrolled less than half time during\nthe spring, the student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan only for the fall semester. Although the loan period (fall only) is\nshorter than an academic year, the remaining period of study (fall through spring) is a full academic year. Therefore, if the\nstudent receives a Direct Loan in the fall, proration of the annual loan limit is not required.\nIn a clock-hour program, non-term program, or a program with non-SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining\nperiod of study is considered less than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program9s\ndefined Title IV academic year. In contrast to standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, if a student enrolled\nin a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is in a remaining period of study shorter than an\nacademic year and receives a Direct Loan, the loan period and the remaining period of study will always be the same. This\nis because for these programs the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program (or remaining portion of\na program) or the academic year.\nFor all types of programs, you determine the prorated loan limit for a student enrolled in a remaining period of study less\nthan an academic year by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by the following fraction:\nUnlike proration for programs that are shorter than an academic year, there is no comparison of weeks and hours. Only\nthe credit or clock hours that the student is scheduled to attend, or is actually attending, at the time of\norigination are used in the calculation.\nProration Examples: Remaining Periods of Study Shorter Than an Academic Year\nExamples 3 through 7 illustrate how the prorated annual loan limit is determined when a student is enrolled in a\nremaining period of study shorter than an academic year.\nSemester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours enrolled in program\nSemester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours in academic year\nVolume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3: Remaining Period = One Quarter', 'Prorating Loan Limits for Remaining Periods Shorter Than an Academic Year\nYou must also prorate loan limits for students enrolled in remaining periods of study shorter than an academic year. This\ncircumstance can occur when a student is enrolled in a program that is one academic year or more in length, but the\nremaining period of study needed to complete the program (sometimes called a <final= period of study) will be shorter\nthan an academic year.\nProration is required only when you know in advance that a student will be enrolled for a remaining period of study that is\nshorter than an academic year. With one exception, if a student originally enrolls for a remaining period of study that is a\nfull academic year in length, but completes the program in less than a full academic year, there is no requirement to\nretroactively prorate the annual loan limit (for the exception, see <Proration of the Annual Loan Limit for Students Who\nTo determine the maximum portion of the $2,420 prorated annual loan limit that the student may receive in\nsubsidized loan funds, multiply the maximum subsidized annual loan limit of $3,500 by the smaller decimal\n(0.44):\n$3,500 x 0.44 = $1,540 subsidized prorated annual loan limit\nThe maximum combined Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount the student can borrow for\nthe program is $2,420, but no more than $1,540 of this amount may be in subsidized loans.\nNote: In Example 1 above and in the other proration examples that follow, the fractions are converted to\ndecimals. As an alternative you could choose to multiply the annual loan limit by the original fraction, though you\nshould be consistent in using one method or the other. Using the fraction 400/900 in Example 1 instead of the\ndecimal 0.44 would result in a slightly higher prorated loan limit: $5,500 x 400/900 = $2,444.\nVolume 8, Chapter 5, Example 2: Non-Term Credit-Hour Program Shorter Than an Academic Year\nAn independent student is enrolled in a 24 quarter-hour, 20-week program.

For\ndependent undergraduates enrolled in preparatory coursework or teacher certification programs, there is just a single\nannual loan limit representing the maximum amount of subsidized and/or unsubsidized loans that the student may\nreceive for an academic year.\nFor example, a dependent undergraduate taking preparatory coursework required for enrollment in a graduate or\nprofessional program could receive up to $5,500 per academic year in Direct Loan funds, which could be all subsidized, all\nunsubsidized, or a combination of subsidized and unsubsidized. In contrast, an independent undergraduate taking the\nsame preparatory coursework could receive up to $12,500 per academic year, not more than $5,500 of which could be\nsubsidized.\nLoan limits for preparatory coursework and teacher certification coursework are not subject to proration (see Chapter 5 of\nthis volume) if the coursework is less than a full academic year.\nCombined Undergraduate and Graduate Programs\nSome programs combine undergraduate and graduate study and allow a student to complete both a bachelor\'s degree\nand a graduate or professional degree within the same program. These are referred to as ""dual degree programs."" For\ninstance, a school could offer a 5-year dual degree program leading to both a bachelor\'s degree and a graduate or\nprofessional degree and could define the first three or four years of study as being at the undergraduate level, and the\nremaining year(s) of study as being at the graduate or professional level. A student may receive Direct Loans at the\napplicable undergraduate annual loan limits (as well as other Title IV aid at the undergraduate level) during the\nundergraduate portion of such a program, and then may receive Direct Loans at the graduate and professional student\nannual loan limit (and also Direct PLUS Loans) for the graduate and professional portion of the program.\nSee Volume 1 for more detailed guidance on student eligibility for Title IV aid in programs that combine undergraduate\nand graduate study, including programs that lead only to a graduate or professional degree, but admit students who do\nnot yet meet the regulatory requirements to be considered graduate or professional degree students.\nStudents Returning for a Second Baccalaureate Degree\nIf a student with a baccalaureate degree enrolls in another baccalaureate program, the student9s grade level for loan limit\npurposes would be based on the amount of work that the school counts toward satisfying the requirements of the new\nprogram. For instance, if your school accepts 30 semester hours of a student9s work in a previous baccalaureate program\ntoward the requirements for a BS in Chemistry at your school and, on that basis, classifies the student at the second-year\nlevel, then the student would be eligible for second-year undergraduate loan limits (see <Loan Limit When a\nBaccalaureate or Associate Degree Is Required for Admission to an Undergraduate Program= earlier in this chapter for the\nloan limit that applies when a student is required to have a prior associate or baccalaureate degree as a condition for\nbeing admitted to an undergraduate program).\nStudents Who Transfer From a Graduate Program to an Undergraduate Program During an Academic Year\nIf a student transfers from a graduate program to an undergraduate program in the middle of an academic year, the\nundergraduate annual loan limit for the student9s grade level applies but amounts previously borrowed at the graduate\nlevel within the same academic year do not count against the undergraduate annual loan limit. However, the total amount\nawarded for the academic year may not exceed the higher (graduate or professional) annual loan limit.\nVolume 8, Chapter 4, Example 1: Transfer From a Graduate to Undergraduate Program During the Same Academic\nYear\nA student who received $10,250 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds for a fall semester loan as a graduate student\nenrolls in an undergraduate program at the same school in the spring semester of the school9s fall-spring\nacademic year and is classified as a third-year independent undergraduate. As a third-year independent\nundergraduate, the student9s annual loan limit is $12,500, not more than $5,500 of which may be subsidized.']","['<1-hop>\n\nGraduate Early From a Clock-Hour Program= later in this chapter). In a standard-term program, or a credit-hour program using SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of study is considered shorter than an academic year if the remaining period contains fewer terms than the number of terms covered by the school9s Title IV academic year. For programs that are offered in a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY; see Chapter 6), the number of terms covered in the school9s Title IV academic year usually does not include a summer <header= or <trailer= term. Consider a student who is enrolled in a four-year program that is offered in an SAY consisting of three quarters plus a summer trailer, and who has completed four academic years of study. The student needs to attend an additional quarter term to complete the program requirements. The final quarter term falls in a new academic year; therefore the annual loan limit must be prorated because the remaining period of study (a single quarter) is less than a full academic year. Similarly, if a student enrolled in a two-year program not offered in an SAY (where the Title IV academic year covers two 15-week semesters) has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to complete the program requirements, the loan limit must be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester. Note that for standard-term programs or credit-hour programs with SE9W nonstandard terms, the length of the loan period does not determine whether a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year. The determining factor is the length of the remaining period of study in which the student is enrolled, which may not be the same as the loan period. For example, if an undergraduate student is enrolled for a full SAY consisting of fall and spring semesters, and will complete the program at the end of the spring term, but is enrolled less than half time during the spring, the student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan only for the fall semester. Although the loan period (fall only) is shorter than an academic year, the remaining period of study (fall through spring) is a full academic year. Therefore, if the student receives a Direct Loan in the fall, proration of the annual loan limit is not required. In a clock-hour program, non-term program, or a program with non-SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of study is considered less than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program9s defined Title IV academic year. In contrast to standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, if a student enrolled in a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is in a remaining period of study shorter than an academic year and receives a Direct Loan, the loan period and the remaining period of study will always be the same. This is because for these programs the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program (or remaining portion of a program) or the academic year. For all types of programs, you determine the prorated loan limit for a student enrolled in a remaining period of study less than an academic year by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by the following fraction: Unlike proration for programs that are shorter than an academic year, there is no comparison of weeks and hours. Only the credit or clock hours that the student is scheduled to attend, or is actually attending, at the time of origination are used in the calculation.', '<2-hop>\n\nProration Examples: Remaining Periods of Study Shorter Than an Academic Year Examples 3 through 7 illustrate how the prorated annual loan limit is determined when a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study shorter than an academic year. Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours enrolled in program Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours in academic year Volume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3: Remaining Period = One Quarter']","Proration applies to students in clock-hour programs when their remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year by reducing the maximum loan amount they can borrow. This situation arises when a student is enrolled in a program that is one academic year or more in length, but the remaining period of study needed to complete the program is less than a full academic year.

### Proration Process
To determine the prorated loan limit for a student in this situation, the following steps are taken:

1. **Identify the Annual Loan Limit**: Determine the applicable annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans based on the student's status (dependent or independent).

2. **Calculate the Fraction**: The proration involves calculating a fraction based on the number of clock or credit hours the student is scheduled to attend compared to the hours defined in the school's academic year. 

3. **Multiply by the Annual Loan Limit**: The annual loan limit is then multiplied by the smaller of the two fractions (based on hours or weeks) to arrive at the prorated loan limit.

### Examples of Proration
1. **Example of a Clock-Hour Program**: 
   - A student is enrolled in a 400 clock-hour, 12-week program, while the school defines the academic year as 900 clock hours and 26 weeks.
   - The calculations would be:
     - Weeks: \( \frac{12}{26} = 0.46 \)
     - Hours: \( \frac{400}{900} = 0.44 \)
   - The smaller decimal (0.44) is used to calculate the prorated loan limit:
     - \( \$5,500 \times 0.44 = \$2,420 \) (combined subsidized and unsubsidized loan limit).

2. **Example of a Non-Term Credit-Hour Program**:
   - An independent student is enrolled in a 24 quarter-hour, 20-week program, with the academic year defined as 36 quarter hours and 30 weeks.
   - The calculations would be:
     - Weeks: \( \frac{20}{30} = 0.67 \)
     - Hours: \( \frac{24}{36} = 0.67 \)
   - The prorated loan limit would be:
     - \( \$9,500 \times 0.67 = \$6,365 \) (combined loan limit).
     - For subsidized loans: \( \$3,500 \times 0.67 = \$2,345 \).

These examples illustrate how proration is applied to ensure that students in clock-hour programs receive loan amounts that reflect their shorter remaining periods of study.","In clock-hour programs, if a student's remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year, the loan limit must be prorated. This is because the remaining period consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program's defined Title IV academic year. Unlike standard-term programs, the loan period and the remaining period of study in clock-hour programs will always be the same, as the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program or the academic year. Proration is determined by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by a fraction based on the credit or clock hours the student is scheduled to attend. Examples of this proration process include scenarios where a student is enrolled in a remaining period of one quarter, as illustrated in Volume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3.",1.0,0.7222222222222222,0.78,0.9457163688775488,0.4444444439506172,0.14285714285714285,14.494394063949585,bm25_rag
"How does the NSLDS system assist in managing borrower information and loan limits, particularly in relation to unallocated consolidation loan amounts?","['teacher certification and preparatory coursework and the applicable annual loan limits.)\nHigher Aggregate Loan Limit for Certain Health Professions Students\nAs explained earlier in this chapter, graduate and professional students who are enrolled in certain health professions\nprograms are eligible for higher annual Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits. These students also have a higher combined\nsubsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit.\nThe combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit for graduate and professional health professions students\nwho are eligible to receive the increased annual unsubsidized amounts is $224,000. Not more than $65,500 of this\namount may be from subsidized loans (see the notes following Table 4 above regarding the $65,500 subsidized aggregate\nloan limit for graduate and professional students).\nIf a student who received increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts for a qualifying health profession program later\nenrolls in a non-health professions program, the student is no longer eligible for the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan\nlimits. However, the additional loan amounts received for the health professions program are not counted toward the\nnormal aggregate loan limit for that student.\nChecking Remaining Eligibility Under the Aggregate Loan Limits\nBefore originating a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, it9s important to make sure the student still has\nremaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limits. As long as there is no conflicting information, you may rely on the\nfinancial aid history (provided on the ISIR as well as on the NSLDS Professional Access website) and the Transfer Student\nMonitoring process (for transfer students only) to tell you if a student is about to exceed the applicable aggregate loan\nlimit. (See Volume 1, Chapter 3 for more detail on NSLDS financial aid history, which may also affect eligibility for other\nTitle IV programs.)\nThe Loan History in NSLDS for a borrower who has received Title IV loans shows Aggregate Loan Information for the\nborrower9s outstanding subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding\nPrincipal Balance amounts shown for a borrower in NSLDS do not include unpaid accrued interest, capitalized interest\n(unpaid interest that has been added to the principal balance of the loan), or other charges, as these amounts are not\ncounted against the aggregate loan limits.\nFor each individual loan that a borrower has received, NSLDS shows both the Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) and the\nAggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). The OPB is what the borrower owes, which may include capitalized\ninterest and other charges. The Agg. OPB is the portion of the OPB that counts against the aggregate loan limits for\nsubsidized and unsubsidized loans.\nFor instance, suppose a student has a Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursed in the amount of $5,000. Over time, $200 in\ninterest accrues and is capitalized. Assuming that the borrower has made no payments on the loan, the OPB on the loan\nwill be $5,200 (this is the amount the borrower owes), and the Agg. OPB will be $5,000 (this is the amount that is counted\nagainst the aggregate loan limit). If you are looking at information in NSLDS for individual loans, it is the Agg. OPB that\nyou should use to determine the student9s remaining loan eligibility under the applicable aggregate loan limit.\nThe Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance amounts displayed in NSLDS for a borrower\nalso include the outstanding portion of consolidation loans (both Direct Consolidation Loans and Federal Consolidation\nLoans made under the FFEL program) attributable to Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Subsidized\nFederal Stafford Loans, and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans that were repaid by the consolidation loan.\nUnallocated Consolidation Loan Amounts\nNSLDS may also show a <Consolidation Loans, Unallocated= amount that is not counted against a borrower9s aggregate\nloan limits. The <Consolidation Loans, Unallocated= amount represents the portion of a consolidation loan that cannot be\nattributed to other loans in the borrower9s loan history. For example, it may represent capitalized interest or non-Title IV\nloans that were consolidated. You are not responsible for determining the origin of any unallocated consolidation loan\namounts.\nTreatment of Consolidated Perkins Loans and PLUS Loans\nA consolidated Perkins Loan or PLUS loan becomes part of the unsubsidized portion of a consolidation loan, but it is not', 'Repayment of the Excess Loan Amount\nIf a student who has inadvertently overborrowed wishes to regain Title IV eligibility by repaying the excess loan amount,\nthe student must contact the applicable servicer and comply with the servicer9s repayment instructions. The school may\nassist the student in identifying and contacting the servicer, but the student, not the school, must make the payment of\nthe excess loan funds in accordance with the servicer9s instructions. Once the student has repaid the excess loan amount\nin full, the servicer will send the student confirmation that the excess loan amount has been repaid. The student or\nservicer must provide a copy of the repayment confirmation to the school. The inadvertent overborrowing is considered to\nhave been resolved as of the date the servicer received the borrower9s full payment of the excess loan amount.\nSatisfactory Repayment Arrangements (<Reaffirmation=)\nA student who has inadvertently overborrowed may also regain Title IV eligibility by making satisfactory repayment\narrangements to repay the excess loan amount. This requirement can be met if the student agrees in writing to repay the\nexcess amount according to the terms and conditions of the promissory note that supported the loan. This is called\n<reaffirmation.= The reaffirmation process includes the following five steps:\n1. Either the student or the school where the student is requesting additional Title IV funds contacts the servicer of the\nloan that caused the overborrowing and explains that the student has inadvertently overborrowed and wishes to\nreaffirm the debt.\n2. The servicer sends the student a reaffirmation agreement.\n3. The student reads, signs, and returns the reaffirmation agreement to the servicer.\n4. The servicer sends the student confirmation that the reaffirmation agreement has been accepted. The student or\nservicer must provide a copy of the confirmation to the school where the student is requesting Title IV funds.\n5. The inadvertent overborrowing is considered to have been resolved as of the date the servicer receives the student9s\nsigned reaffirmation agreement.\nConsolidation of Loan Amounts That Exceed the Annual or Aggregate Loan Limit\nIf a borrower who inadvertently received more than the annual or aggregate loan limits has consolidated the loan(s) that\ncaused the borrower to exceed the loan limit into a Direct Consolidation Loan, the Direct Consolidation Loan is considered\na satisfactory arrangement to repay the excess amount. This restores the borrower9s eligibility for Title IV aid. If the school\nwhere the student is seeking aid confirms through NSLDS that the loan(s) have been consolidated, no further action is\nrequired. Note, however, that consolidation of an amount that exceeded the combined aggregate loan limit for Direct\nSubsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans does not automatically make a student eligible for additional Direct Loan\nfunds.\nbefore the student can receive additional Title IV aid.\nRegaining Title IV Eligibility After Inadvertent Overborrowing\n34 CFR 668.35(d)\nDCL GEN-15-20\nDCL GEN-13-02\nDepartment of Education Office of the Inspector General Hotline', 'If your school participates in the Direct PLUS program but a student9s parent cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the\nstudent is allowed to borrow additional unsubsidized funds (see <Criteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan Funds= in Chapter 4 of this volume).\nRequired Counseling for Direct PLUS Loan Applicants With Adverse Credit\nAny student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has an adverse credit history but qualifies by obtaining an endorser\nor documenting that there are extenuating circumstances must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling on the\nDepartment9s StudentAid.gov website.\nAdverse Credit History and Default\nAlthough a default on a Title IV loan will generally appear in a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant9s credit record\nand result in the individual being determined to have an adverse credit history, being in default on a Title IV loan and\nhaving an adverse credit history are separate eligibility issues. A Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified through the\nDepartment9s National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as being in default on a Title IV loan and who has also been\ndetermined to have an adverse credit history (due to the default and/or other adverse credit conditions) cannot qualify for\na Direct PLUS Loan simply by obtaining an endorser or by providing acceptable documentation of extenuating\ncircumstances.

In this circumstance you\ncannot assume that the approved credit check result supersedes the information in NSLDS. The default must be resolved\nbefore you can disburse Direct PLUS Loan funds or other Title IV aid to the applicant.\nDirect PLUS Loan Application\nSchools that offer Direct PLUS Loans have the option of requiring student and parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants to\ncomplete the Direct PLUS Loan Application (formally known as the ""Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request for Supplemental\nInformation"") on the Department\'s StudentAid.gov website as the first step in applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. The Direct\nPLUS Loan Application collects the requested loan amount, the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended, and\nother information related to processing the requested Direct PLUS Loan.\nUse of the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov is not required. Schools may choose to develop their own\nprocesses for obtaining the information needed to originate Direct PLUS Loans.\nAlthough the Department9s FAFSA Processing System (FPS) matches student Direct PLUS Loan applicants against NSLDS\nto determine if they are in default on a Title IV loan, it does not perform this match for parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants.\nHowever, the Department conducts an NSLDS default check on all Direct PLUS Loan applicants (both students and\nparents) who complete the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov.\nSchools that use the Direct PLUS Loan Application are notified of the result of the NSLDS default check through the\nCommon Origination and Disbursement (COD) System.

For example, a student\nenrolled in a nine-month Doctor of Dentistry program is eligible for the regular Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual maximum\nfor a graduate or professional student ($20,500), plus the maximum increased unsubsidized amount of $20,000, for a\ntotal Direct Unsubsidized Loan maximum of $40,500 per academic year.\nGraduate and professional students who qualify for the higher annual Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits are also eligible for\na higher combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit, as explained later in this chapter.\nProration of the Increased Health Professions Annual Loan Limit for an Academic Year Covering 10 or 11 Months\nTables 3A and 3B above show the increased unsubsidized loan limits for programs with an academic year of either nine\nmonths or 12 months. For eligible health professions programs with an academic year covering 10 or 11 months, the\nannual additional unsubsidized loan limit must be prorated. If the academic year covers 10 or 11 months, the prorated\nannual loan limit is determined by dividing the applicable loan limit for an academic year covering nine months by nine,\nand then multiplying the result by 10 or 11. For example, the prorated increased unsubsidized loan limit for a Doctor of\nDentistry program with an 11-month academic year would be $24,444, calculated as follows:\n$20,000 ÷ 9 = $2,222.22\n$2,222.22 x 11 = $24,444.42, rounded to $24,444\nForeign Schools May Not Award Increased Unsubsidized Loan Amounts\nForeign schools that participate in the Direct Loan Program may not award the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan\namounts to health professions students.\nAggregate Loan Limit Overview\nAs explained earlier in this chapter, there are limits on the maximum Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan\namounts that a student may receive each academic year (annual loan limits). There are also limits on a student9s\nmaximum outstanding total Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan debt. These are called aggregate loan\nlimits. A borrower who has reached the aggregate borrowing limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized\nLoans may not receive additional loans. Once the loans are repaid, in full or in part, the borrower may apply for additional\nloans.\nTo ensure that a student doesn9t exceed the aggregate loan limits, the student9s FAFSA form data is matched with NSLDS.\nIf the student has exceeded or is approaching the aggregate loan limits, this will be noted in the ISIR. If a student\ntransfers to your school, you must inform NSLDS so that it can begin the Transfer Student Monitoring process.\nAggregate Loan Limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\nThe aggregate loan limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are shown in Table 4 below.""]","[""<1-hop>\n\nprovided by those companies are already offered free of charge through the Department or the borrower's loan servicer; Provide a general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers (i.e. student loan interest deduction); and Require the borrower to provide current information concerning their name, address, Social Security number, references, and driver9s license number and state of issuance, as well as the borrower9s expected permanent address, the address of their next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower9s expected employer, if known (see also < Providing Borrower Information at Separation= below).

Here’s how it assists in this process:

1. **Loan History Tracking**: NSLDS provides a comprehensive loan history for borrowers, detailing both the Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) and the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). The OPB reflects the total amount owed, including capitalized interest and other charges, while the Agg. OPB indicates the portion that counts against the aggregate loan limits for subsidized and unsubsidized loans.

2. **Aggregate Loan Limits**: Before originating new loans, schools can check a student's financial aid history through NSLDS to ensure they have not exceeded their aggregate loan limits. This is essential for compliance with federal regulations regarding borrowing limits.

3. **Unallocated Consolidation Loan Amounts**: NSLDS may display a ""Consolidation Loans, Unallocated"" amount, which represents portions of a consolidation loan that cannot be attributed to specific loans in the borrower’s history. This amount does not count against the borrower’s aggregate loan limits. For example, it may include capitalized interest or non-Title IV loans that were consolidated. Schools are not responsible for determining the origin of these unallocated amounts, simplifying the management of borrower information.

4. **Impact on Borrower Eligibility**: If a borrower consolidates loans that exceed the annual or aggregate loan limits, the resulting Direct Consolidation Loan is considered a satisfactory arrangement to repay the excess amount, thus restoring the borrower’s eligibility for Title IV aid. NSLDS confirms this consolidation, allowing schools to proceed with aid disbursement without further action.

In summary, NSLDS assists in managing borrower information and loan limits by providing detailed loan histories, tracking aggregate limits, and clarifying the treatment of unallocated consolidation loan amounts, which helps ensure compliance and supports borrowers in maintaining their eligibility for federal aid.","The NSLDS system assists in managing borrower information by providing loan holders with the necessary data during the exit counseling process, as part of the Department's online counseling services.

There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'completing their program of study so that the school can provide exit counseling;\nProvide information on how the borrower can access their records in the National Student Loan Data System\n(NSLDS); and\nProvide the name of the individual the borrower may contact if the borrower has questions about the borrower9s\nrights and responsibilities or the terms and conditions of the loan.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Graduate and Professional Student Direct PLUS Loan Borrowers\nThe information that must be covered in entrance counseling for graduate and professional student Direct PLUS Loan\nborrowers is summarized below. For more detailed information, refer to the regulations cited at the end of this section.\nEntrance counseling for graduate or professional student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers must:\nInform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on a range of student levels of\nindebtedness depending on the types of loans the borrower has received, or based on the average indebtedness of\nother borrowers in the same program at the same school;\nInform the borrower of the option to pay interest on a Direct PLUS Loan while the borrower is in school;\nFor a graduate or professional student PLUS Loan borrower who has received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, provide the borrower\nwith a comparison of:\nThe maximum interest rate for a Direct Subsidized Loan and a Direct Unsubsidized Loan and the maximum\ninterest rate for a Direct PLUS Loan;\nPeriods when interest accrues on a Direct Subsidized Loan and a Direct Unsubsidized Loan and periods when\ninterest accrues on a Direct PLUS Loan; and\nThe point when a Direct Subsidized Loan and a Direct Unsubsidized Loan enters repayment, and the point when\na Direct PLUS Loan enters repayment; and\nFor a graduate or professional student PLUS Loan borrower who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan,\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, provide the\ninformation specified above under <Required Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan Borrowers.=\nRequired Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Entrance\nCounseling\n34 CFR 685.304(a)(6)\nHEA Sec. 485(l)(2)(I)\nRequired Content for Student Direct PLUS Loan Entrance Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(a)(7)', ""If you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower has received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of their\nfinancial need, and the student is still enrolled for the loan period, you must return the subsidized loan amount for which\nthe student was ineligible and ask the student if they wish to replace the subsidized funds with a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan. If the student agrees to accept the unsubsidized loan funds and they also received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for\nthe same loan period as the Direct Subsidized Loan, you may increase the amount of the Direct Unsubsidized Loan\ndisbursements by the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive.

You may do this either by adjusting an existing Direct Subsidized Loan upwards, or, if the\nstudent does not have an existing Direct Subsidized Loan, by originating a new Direct Subsidized Loan. Replacing a Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan with a Direct Subsidized Loan in this circumstance does not require obtaining the student9s consent.\nDirect Loan Overawards\nAs explained in Volume 4, Chapter 3, an overaward exists when a student9s aid package exceeds their need or overall\nCOA. If you discover that a student who received Direct Loans has been overawarded and your school has already\nreceived and disbursed some or all of the Direct Loan funds, you have the following options:\nIf the student9s aid package includes a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, or a nonfederal education loan,\nand the aid package doesn9t already apply these loans toward the student9s SAI, you may choose to adjust the aid\npackage to have all or a portion of these loans replace the SAI, thus reducing or eliminating the overaward (for more\ndetail and examples, see <Substituting for the SAI= in Volume 3, Chapter 3).\nIf you have not yet made the second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan, you can reduce or cancel the\nsecond or subsequent disbursement.\nIf the overaward situation occurs after the full amount of a Direct Loan has been disbursed, you do not need to adjust the\namount of the loan. However, you might have to adjust the aid package to prevent an overaward of Campus-Based funds\nor to prevent the total aid package from exceeding the student9s need.\nAlthough a school isn9t required to return Direct Loan funds that were disbursed to the borrower (either directly or by\napplying them to the student's account) before the overaward situation occurred, the law doesn9t prevent your school\nfrom returning funds that were applied to the student account if you choose to do so. A borrower who receives a direct\npayment of loan funds is not required to repay an overawarded amount, unless the overaward was caused by the\nborrower9s misreporting or withholding of information.\nLoan Periods\nThe loan period (also referred to as the <period of enrollment=) is the period for which a Direct Loan is intended. It must\ncoincide with an academic period established by the school for which institutional charges are generally assessed (e.g.,\nsemester, trimester, quarter, length of the student9s program, or academic year). It9s important to define the loan period\nat the beginning of the loan awarding process, because the timing and amount of Direct Loan disbursements are tied to\nthe loan period.\nGenerally, the loan period may not include terms in which a student is ineligible (for example, if the student is not enrolled\nduring a particular term or is enrolled less than half time during a term). There is a limited exception to this rule if the loan\nperiod begins and ends with a term in which the student is eligible for Direct Loans, but the first and last terms of the loan""]","[""<1-hop>\n\nprovided by those companies are already offered free of charge through the Department or the borrower's loan servicer; Provide a general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers (i.e. student loan interest deduction); and Require the borrower to provide current information concerning their name, address, Social Security number, references, and driver9s license number and state of issuance, as well as the borrower9s expected permanent address, the address of their next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower9s expected employer, if known (see also < Providing Borrower Information at Separation= below). As stated above, Direct Loan exit counseling must provide borrowers with the information the Department makes available in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA. This section of the law requires the Department to make available to postsecondary schools and other entities a wide variety of information about federal student assistance programs, including information to help students assess the debt burden and repayment obligations that will be incurred as a result of receiving Title IV loans. As noted below under < Counseling Methods,= documentation that a borrower has completed the Department9s online exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan exit counseling requirements.

Schools can also view completion information on the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) System website.

How does the FSA Handbook guide schools in handling loan adjustments for clinical work and the death of a Title IV aid recipient?,"['may not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of\npayments while the student was enrolled at least half time.\nIf a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death,\nthe school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of\nthe original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent\nstudent (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4\nof this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate\na Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended.\nFor additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the\nFSA Handbook.\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term\nVolume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and\nnonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine\nweeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education\nprogram work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical\nWork in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below.\nIf clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard\nterm, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.\nIf a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the\nstarting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of\nthe clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on\nAugust 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not\nbegin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be\nthe beginning date of the term.\nIf the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a\nDirect Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the\ncase).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the\nspring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as\nSeptember 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which\nit is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term.\nIf loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the\nnormal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies,\nand the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of\na fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that\nfall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1\nthrough June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1\nthrough June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for\ninformation on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits).\nIf there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work,\nand the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to\nbegin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two\nloan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.', 'Volume 8\nThe Direct Loan Program\nIntroduction\nUnder the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loan Program), the U.S. Department of Education (the\nDepartment) makes loans to help students and parents pay the cost of attendance (COA) at a postsecondary school.

Other circumstances when you must update loan data in the COD System include:\nWhen the borrower requests the cancellation of a loan or a loan disbursement;\nWhen the borrower does not begin attendance, or does not begin attendance on at least a half-time basis, in a\npayment period that was included in the originally reported loan period and you did not make any disbursements for\nthat payment period (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for information on payment periods);\nWhen you determine that the borrower is not eligible to receive a Direct Loan for a payment period that was part of\nthe originally reported loan period (for example, due to the borrower9s failure to meet SAP standards, because the\nborrower has an overpayment, or because a change in circumstances makes the borrower ineligible for a subsidized\nloan);\nWhen the borrower withdraws during a payment period that was included in the originally reported loan period, and\nas a result, the entire amount of the loan that was intended for that payment period is returned under the Return of\nTitle IV Funds (R2T4) calculation;\nFor clock-hour programs, non-term credit-hour programs, and certain types of nonstandard term credit-hour\nprograms, when the borrower fails to progress to the next payment period or academic year as scheduled.\nNote: In limited circumstances, it is not necessary to adjust the loan period for a Direct Loan if the borrower is ineligible\nto receive a Direct Loan during one or more terms within the loan period due to not being enrolled or being enrolled on a\nless-than-half-time basis. For details, see <Loan Periods= later in this chapter.\nCorrecting Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan Awarding Errors"", 'hour, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is offered in modules, the minimum loan period is still the lesser of the\nacademic year or the program length (or remaining portion of the program).\nFor Title IV aid purposes, students are allowed to skip one or more modules. However, if a loan period includes modules\nthat the student does not attend, the COA for the loan period may not include costs associated with those modules.\nMinimum Loan Period: Standard Term Combined With an Intersession\nAs we explain under <Intersessions= in Volume 3, Chapter 1, in limited cases for academic programs offered in standard\nterms, a short nonstandard term (often called an <intersession=) may be combined with a preceding or following standard\nterm and considered to be a single standard term. In such cases, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is different\ndepending on whether a student attends the intersession. If a student who attends the intersession requests a loan for the\ncombined term, the loan period includes the standard term plus the intersession. However, if the student attends only the\nstandard term and is not enrolled in the intersession that is attached to that term, the loan period includes only the\nstandard term.\nMaximum Loan Periods\nThe maximum period for which you may originate a Direct Loan is generally an academic year. However, if your school\napplies the annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans to a period of time greater than\nan academic year, you may originate a Direct Loan for that longer period of time. For example, a school might offer an\n1100 clock-hour program and define the academic year as 900 clock hours but could choose to allow students to receive\njust one annual loan limit for the entire 1100-hour program. In that case, the loan period would correspond to the length\nof the program, a period of time that is longer than the academic year.\nDirect Loan Disbursement Requirements\nFor general guidance on the timing of disbursements made under the Title IV programs, see Volume 3, Chapter 1. For\nguidance on reporting Title IV program disbursements through the COD System and the rules for making early\ndisbursements, late disbursements, and retroactive payments, see Volume 4, Chapter 2. In this section we discuss certain\nother disbursement requirements that are specific to the Direct Loan Program.\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal Direct Loan disbursement\nrequirements that apply when periods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\nRequirement for Substantially Equal Disbursements\nDirect Loans must be disbursed in substantially equal installments, regardless of any difference in costs for different\npayment periods that are within the same loan period, and no Direct Loan disbursement may exceed one-half of the loan\nMaximum Loan Period\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(10)(iv)\nDetermining Direct Loan Disbursement Dates and Amounts\n34 CFR 685.303(d)', ""Regardless of the length of the loan period, you may disburse a Direct Loan in a single installment if the loan is to cover a\nstudent's COA in a study abroad program and your school9s calculated cohort default rate is less than 5% for the most\nrecent fiscal year for which data are available.\nDirect Loan Disbursements for Completed Payment Periods\nThe Direct Loan Program regulations allow a school to include in a single disbursement the disbursements for any\npayment periods that have ended. However, the COD System (except for schools exempted because of low default rates)\nrequires schools to enter at least two anticipated disbursement dates. Therefore, when creating a loan origination record\nfor a Direct Loan when you intend to include in a disbursement loan proceeds for any payment periods that have been\ncompleted, you should enter the actual date you anticipate making the disbursement as the anticipated date for all\ndisbursements that would be included. For example, consider a school attempting to submit an origination when the data\nis as follows:\nLoan period: 09/01 - 05/30 (fall through spring)\nMinimum number of disbursements normally required: 2\nPayment period 1: 09/01 - 12/20\nPayment period 2: 01/06 - 05/30\nDate school creates origination record: 01/09\nIf you anticipate disbursing the loan proceeds for both payment periods on January 16, you should enter January 16 as the\ndate for both the first and second disbursements when you create the origination record.\nDirect Loan Disbursements Made After the Date of the Borrower9s Death\nIf a school learns that a student or parent Direct Loan borrower has died before one or more disbursements of a loan have\nbeen made, the school must cancel all pending disbursements. Direct Loan funds cannot be disbursed when there is no\npossibility of repayment. In addition, if a school is not informed of a student or parent borrower9s death until after one or\nmore loan disbursements have been made, the school must return to the Department the full amount of all loan funds\nthat were credited to the student9s school account after the date of the borrower9s death (if the post-death disbursement\ncreated a credit balance that was paid directly to the student or parent, the school is not responsible for returning the\ncredit balance amount).\nDisbursements after the date of the borrower9s death are most likely to occur when a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower\ndies. If an enrolled student dies, the school will generally learn of the death in a timely manner and can cancel any\npending loan disbursements. However, if a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower dies, the student or other family members\nStudy Abroad Program Exception\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(6)(i)(B)\nDirect Loan Disbursement After One or More Payment Periods Have Elapsed\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(4)(i)""]","['<1-hop>\n\nmay not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of payments while the student was enrolled at least half time. If a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death, the school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent student (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4 of this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.', '<2-hop>\n\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and nonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","The FSA Handbook provides specific guidance for schools on how to handle loan adjustments in two key situations: when a Title IV aid recipient dies and when clinical work is included in a standard term.

1. **Handling Loan Adjustments for the Death of a Title IV Aid Recipient**:
   - If a school learns that a Direct Loan borrower (either a student or a parent) has died, it must cancel all pending disbursements. Direct Loan funds cannot be disbursed when there is no possibility of repayment.
   - If disbursements have already been made after the date of the borrower's death, the school is required to return the full amount of those funds to the Department of Education. This includes any funds credited to the student’s account after the date of death. However, if a credit balance was paid directly to the student or parent, the school is not responsible for returning that amount.
   - In cases where a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan dies, the school should check if there is a surviving parent who can take out a new Direct PLUS Loan for the amount that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended.

2. **Loan Adjustments for Clinical Work**:
   - The Handbook outlines that if clinical work is included in a standard term or a substantially equal nonstandard term (SE9W) and meets specific criteria, exceptions to normal loan period and disbursement rules may apply.
   - If clinical work begins before the term starts, the loan period start date is adjusted to the beginning of the clinical work. Conversely, if the clinical work ends after the term's end date, the loan period end date is adjusted to the end of the clinical work.
   - For example, if a fall semester starts on September 1 but includes clinical work beginning on August 15, the loan period would be reported as August 15 through May 31. Similarly, if clinical work extends beyond the term's end date, the loan period would reflect that extended date.

These guidelines ensure that schools manage Direct Loan funds appropriately in the event of a borrower’s death and accommodate the unique scheduling of clinical work in academic programs. For further details on actions required when a Title IV aid recipient dies, schools are directed to refer to Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.","The FSA Handbook provides guidance for schools on handling loan adjustments in two specific scenarios. Firstly, when a Title IV aid recipient dies, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original loan that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended. This is detailed in Appendix B of the FSA Handbook. Secondly, for clinical work included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the FSA Handbook allows for exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules. If clinical work begins before or ends after the normal term dates, the loan period start and end dates must be adjusted accordingly. This ensures that the academic year period and payment period dates align with the clinical work schedule, as explained in Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook.",1.0,1.0,0.77,0.9646348182751869,0.49999999949999996,0.1,9.921792030334473,bm25_rag
"What happens to a student's Direct Unsubsidized Loan eligibility if their parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan, and how does entrance counseling play a role in this process?","['Chapter 2\nDirect Loan Counseling\nCounseling Overview\nFirst-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a\nDirect Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled\non at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'completing their program of study so that the school can provide exit counseling;\nProvide information on how the borrower can access their records in the National Student Loan Data System\n(NSLDS); and\nProvide the name of the individual the borrower may contact if the borrower has questions about the borrower9s\nrights and responsibilities or the terms and conditions of the loan.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Graduate and Professional Student Direct PLUS Loan Borrowers\nThe information that must be covered in entrance counseling for graduate and professional student Direct PLUS Loan\nborrowers is summarized below. For more detailed information, refer to the regulations cited at the end of this section.\nEntrance counseling for graduate or professional student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers must:\nInform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on a range of student levels of\nindebtedness depending on the types of loans the borrower has received, or based on the average indebtedness of\nother borrowers in the same program at the same school;\nInform the borrower of the option to pay interest on a Direct PLUS Loan while the borrower is in school;\nFor a graduate or professional student PLUS Loan borrower who has received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, provide the borrower\nwith a comparison of:\nThe maximum interest rate for a Direct Subsidized Loan and a Direct Unsubsidized Loan and the maximum\ninterest rate for a Direct PLUS Loan;\nPeriods when interest accrues on a Direct Subsidized Loan and a Direct Unsubsidized Loan and periods when\ninterest accrues on a Direct PLUS Loan; and\nThe point when a Direct Subsidized Loan and a Direct Unsubsidized Loan enters repayment, and the point when\na Direct PLUS Loan enters repayment; and\nFor a graduate or professional student PLUS Loan borrower who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan,\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, provide the\ninformation specified above under <Required Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan Borrowers.=\nRequired Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Entrance\nCounseling\n34 CFR 685.304(a)(6)\nHEA Sec. 485(l)(2)(I)\nRequired Content for Student Direct PLUS Loan Entrance Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(a)(7)', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default.

For more detailed information, refer to the regulations cited at the end of this\nsection.\nEntrance counseling for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loan borrowers must:\nExplain the use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN);\nEmphasize the importance of the loan repayment obligation;\nDescribe the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, delinquent debt collection procedures\nunder Federal law, and litigation;\nEmphasize that the borrower must repay the full amount of the loan even if the borrower does not complete the\nprogram, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain\nemployment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services\nthat the student paid for with the loan;\nInform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on a range of student levels of\nindebtedness depending on the types of loans the borrower has received, or based on the average indebtedness of\nother borrowers in the same program at the same school;\nExplain how accepting the loan will affect the borrower9s eligibility for other forms of student financial assistance;\nProvide information on how interest accrues and is capitalized during periods when the interest is not paid by either\nthe borrower or the Department;\nInform the borrower of the option to pay the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan while the borrower is in school;\nExplain the definition of half-time enrollment at the school and the consequences of not maintaining half-time\nenrollment;\nExplain the importance of contacting the appropriate offices at the school if the borrower withdraws before\nDirect Loan Entrance Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(a)\nLoan Counseling Requirements and Flexibilities\nDCL GEN-15-06', ""If you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower has received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of their\nfinancial need, and the student is still enrolled for the loan period, you must return the subsidized loan amount for which\nthe student was ineligible and ask the student if they wish to replace the subsidized funds with a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan. If the student agrees to accept the unsubsidized loan funds and they also received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for\nthe same loan period as the Direct Subsidized Loan, you may increase the amount of the Direct Unsubsidized Loan\ndisbursements by the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. If the student did\nnot receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you may originate a new Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the amount of the Direct\nSubsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. The new Direct Unsubsidized Loan must have the same loan\nperiod and disbursement dates as the Direct Subsidized Loan.\nIf the student does not agree to have the excess subsidized loan funds replaced by a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must\nstill return the ineligible Direct Subsidized Loan amount.\nIf you discover that a student received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of financial need after the student is no\nlonger enrolled for the loan period, you are not required to take any action to eliminate the excess subsidized loan\namount.\nIf you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower who was eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan instead received a\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan, you must correct the error (even if the loan period has ended) by submitting a downward\nadjustment to reduce or eliminate the Direct Unsubsidized Loan, as appropriate, and replacing it with the same amount of\nDirect Subsidized Loan funds. You may do this either by adjusting an existing Direct Subsidized Loan upwards, or, if the\nstudent does not have an existing Direct Subsidized Loan, by originating a new Direct Subsidized Loan. Replacing a Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan with a Direct Subsidized Loan in this circumstance does not require obtaining the student9s consent.\nDirect Loan Overawards\nAs explained in Volume 4, Chapter 3, an overaward exists when a student9s aid package exceeds their need or overall\nCOA. If you discover that a student who received Direct Loans has been overawarded and your school has already\nreceived and disbursed some or all of the Direct Loan funds, you have the following options:\nIf the student9s aid package includes a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, or a nonfederal education loan,\nand the aid package doesn9t already apply these loans toward the student9s SAI, you may choose to adjust the aid\npackage to have all or a portion of these loans replace the SAI, thus reducing or eliminating the overaward (for more\ndetail and examples, see <Substituting for the SAI= in Volume 3, Chapter 3).\nIf you have not yet made the second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan, you can reduce or cancel the\nsecond or subsequent disbursement.\nIf the overaward situation occurs after the full amount of a Direct Loan has been disbursed, you do not need to adjust the\namount of the loan. However, you might have to adjust the aid package to prevent an overaward of Campus-Based funds\nor to prevent the total aid package from exceeding the student9s need.\nAlthough a school isn9t required to return Direct Loan funds that were disbursed to the borrower (either directly or by\napplying them to the student's account) before the overaward situation occurred, the law doesn9t prevent your school\nfrom returning funds that were applied to the student account if you choose to do so. A borrower who receives a direct\npayment of loan funds is not required to repay an overawarded amount, unless the overaward was caused by the\nborrower9s misreporting or withholding of information.\nLoan Periods\nThe loan period (also referred to as the <period of enrollment=) is the period for which a Direct Loan is intended. It must\ncoincide with an academic period established by the school for which institutional charges are generally assessed (e.g.,\nsemester, trimester, quarter, length of the student9s program, or academic year). It9s important to define the loan period\nat the beginning of the loan awarding process, because the timing and amount of Direct Loan disbursements are tied to\nthe loan period.\nGenerally, the loan period may not include terms in which a student is ineligible (for example, if the student is not enrolled\nduring a particular term or is enrolled less than half time during a term). There is a limited exception to this rule if the loan\nperiod begins and ends with a term in which the student is eligible for Direct Loans, but the first and last terms of the loan"", 'Exit Counseling\nA Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan borrower who is graduating, leaving\nschool, or dropping below half-time enrollment is required to complete exit counseling. If the student withdraws without\nnotifying your school, you must confirm that they have completed online counseling or mail exit counseling material to\nthe student at their last known address. You may also email the information to the student9s home (not school) email\naddress if you have it. The PDF version of the Direct Loan Exit Counseling Guide satisfies this requirement. You may also\nsend the student a direct link to the exit counseling materials online. Whatever method you choose must be used within\n30 days of learning that the borrower has withdrawn or failed to participate in an exit counseling session.\nWhen mailing exit materials to a student who has left school, you9re not required to use certified mail with a return receipt\nrequested, but you must document in their file that the materials were sent. If they don9t provide updated contact\ninformation, you don9t need to take further action.\nThe required content of exit counseling is summarized in the section that follows. For more detailed information, refer to\nthe regulations cited at the end of the section.\nRequired Exit Counseling Content\nExit counseling must:\nInform the student borrower of the average anticipated monthly repayment amount based on the student borrower9s\nindebtedness or on the average indebtedness of student borrowers who have received Direct Loans for attendance\nat the same school or in the same program of study at the same school;\nReview all available Direct Loan repayment plan options, including a description of the different features of each plan\nand sample information showing the average anticipated monthly payments, and the difference in interest paid and\ntotal payments under each plan;\nExplain the options to prepay each loan, to pay each loan on a shorter schedule, and to change repayment plans;\nProvide information on the effects of loan consolidation;\nInclude debt management strategies that are designed to facilitate repayment;\nExplain to the borrower how to contact their loan servicer;\nExplain the use of an MPN;\nEmphasize the importance of the loan repayment obligation;\nEmphasize that the borrower must repay the full amount of the loan even if the borrower does not complete the\nprogram, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain\nemployment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services\nthat the student paid for with the loan;\nDescribe the likely consequences of default;\nProvide a general description of the terms and conditions under which a borrower may obtain full or partial\nforgiveness or discharge of a loan, defer repayment of a loan, or be granted forbearance on a loan;\nProvide a copy, either in print or by electronic means, of the information the Department makes available in\naccordance with section 485(d) of the HEA (see below);\nReview information on the availability of the Department9s Student Loan Ombudsman9s office;\nInform the borrower of the availability of Title IV loan information in NSLDS and how NSLDS can be used to obtain\nTitle IV loan status information;\nInform the borrower that (1) they may be contacted during the repayment period by third-party student debt relief\ncompanies; (2) the borrower should use caution when dealing with those companies; and (3) the services typically']","['<1-hop>\n\nEffect of a Change in Student Status on Aggregate Loan Limits In some cases, a student may qualify for higher loan limits but then lose eligibility for the higher limits due to a change in status. One such situation is when a dependent undergraduate qualifies for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, but in a subsequent academic year the student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan. In this circumstance the dependent student no longer qualifies for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. During any academic year when a dependent student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student is subject to the dependent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student otherwise would have been eligible to receive under the dependent undergraduate annual loan limits are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the $31,000 combined subsidized and unsubsidized dependent undergraduate aggregate limit (see Example 3 below). A similar situation occurs when a student who received loans for a graduate or professional degree program later returns to school and enrolls in an undergraduate program. The student is then subject to the undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student previously received as an undergraduate are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the undergraduate aggregate loan limit (see Example 2 earlier in this chapter). Volume 8, Chapter 4, Example 3: Aggregate Loan Limits and Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Amounts When Parents Are Unable To Obtain Direct PLUS Loans A dependent student receives additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the additional amounts available to independent undergraduates) for the first three years of a four-year program because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan for each of those years. For each of the first three years, the student receives the maximum subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts under the independent student annual loan limits (remember that the annual subsidized maximums are the same for dependent and independent undergraduates): First Year (independent student loan limit) $3,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Second Year (independent student loan limit) $4,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Third Year (independent student loan limit) $5,500 subsidized $7,000 unsubsidized ($5,000 more than dependent maximum) Total $13,500 subsidized $19,000 unsubsidized ($13,000 more than dependent maximum) In the fourth year, the parent is eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, so the student is then subject to the annual and aggregate loan limits for a dependent undergraduate. The dependent student received a total of $13,500 in Direct Subsidized Loan funds and $19,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds ($32,500 combined subsidized and unsubsidized total) for the first three years when the student9s parent was unable to obtain Direct PLUS Loans. These are the same amounts that an independent student who qualified for the maximum annual loan limit each year could have received. If the student9s parent had been able to receive Direct PLUS Loans during each of the first three years and the student received the maximum subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts under the', '<2-hop>\n\nEntrance Counseling Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. For this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student who requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before the authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan to a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling. Entrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are about to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person counseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. If entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable steps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the terms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the borrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic document. Your school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance education, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed. You may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance counseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements are reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that unreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling can include one or more of the following: Extra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods; A requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though you cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan); A requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or A requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.']","If a student's parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan, it does not directly affect the student's eligibility for a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. The eligibility for Direct Unsubsidized Loans is determined independently of the parent's loan status. However, it is important to note that the overall financial aid package may be adjusted based on the availability of the Direct PLUS Loan, which could potentially impact the amount of other loans the student is eligible to receive.

Entrance counseling plays a crucial role in the loan process for students. It is a requirement for all first-time borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and student Direct PLUS Loans. This counseling provides essential information about the terms and conditions of the loans, the responsibilities of the borrower, and the implications of borrowing. Schools must ensure that students complete this counseling before the first disbursement of their loans. 

In summary, while a parent's eligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not change a student's eligibility for a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, the financial aid package may be adjusted accordingly. Entrance counseling is a mandatory step that helps prepare students for their borrowing responsibilities.","If a dependent student's parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student no longer qualifies for the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. Instead, the student is subject to the dependent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers, ensuring they understand the terms and conditions of the loan and their responsibility to repay it. This counseling must be completed before the first disbursement of the loan, providing comprehensive information to the borrower.",1.0,0.5714285714285714,0.67,0.9440597016084059,0.2857142853061225,0.14285714285714285,5.77565598487854,bm25_rag

The federal government generally\ncharges interest on Direct Unsubsidized Loans during all periods, with limited exceptions (for example, during periods of\ndeferment for cancer treatment).\nTo be eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, an undergraduate student attending a\nschool that participates in the Federal Pell Grant Program must first have received a determination of their Pell Grant\neligibility for the period of enrollment for which the student is requesting a loan.\nNo Minimum Age To Receive a Direct Loan\nStudents who are minors may receive Direct Loans, but they may not refuse to repay the loans based on a <defense of\ninfancy= (that is, by claiming that they were too young to enter into the contract of signing the promissory note).\nRequirement To Offer Both Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans\nDirect Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are two components of a single loan program.

For example, if a student9s biological or legal adoptive parents are divorced, they may decide to each take out a\nDirect PLUS Loan for an agreed upon amount (not to exceed the student9s COA, minus other financial assistance (OFA)) to\nhelp pay for the cost of the student9s education.\nRequirement for Dependent Students To File a FAFSA Form\nIn all cases, the dependent student on whose behalf a parent has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan must have filed a FAFSA\nform and received an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or FAFSA Submission Summary (see Chapter 1 of the\nApplication and Verification Guide for information on the ISIR and FAFSA Submission Summary). This requirement ensures\nthat student eligibility data matches are conducted to verify that the dependent student on whose behalf the parent is\nborrowing:\nIs not in default on a Title IV loan and does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant;\nHas had their Social Security number verified by the Social Security Administration; and\nHas had their citizenship status confirmed by either the Social Security Administration or the Department of\nHomeland Security.\nNote that this requirement is for the student to submit a FAFSA form. It is not a requirement for the parent borrower to\nsubmit a FAFSA form in the parent9s name, and it does not preclude an otherwise eligible parent whose information is not\nincluded on the FAFSA form (sometimes referred to as a <non-custodial= parent) from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan.\nBefore originating a Direct PLUS Loan for a parent borrower, schools must review the ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary\nof the dependent student to ensure there are no student eligibility issues that must be resolved before the parent can\nreceive the Direct PLUS Loan.\nAdverse Credit History\nAn individual with an adverse credit history is prohibited from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan unless they meet additional\neligibility requirements. The Department obtains a credit report on each student or parent applicant for a Direct PLUS\nLoan. An applicant is considered to have an adverse credit history if:\nThey have one or more debts with a total combined outstanding balance greater than $2,085 that (1) are 90 or more\ndays delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or (2) have been placed in collection or charged-off during the two\nyears preceding the date of the credit report; or\nDuring the five years preceding the date of the credit report, the applicant has been determined to be in default on a\ndebt; has had debts discharged in bankruptcy; or has been the subject of foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage\ngarnishment, or write-off of a Title IV debt.\nFor Direct PLUS Loan eligibility purposes, <charged-off= means a debt that has been written off as a loss, but that is still\nsubject to collection action. <In collection= means a debt that has been placed with a collection agency by a creditor or\nthat is subject to more intensive efforts by a creditor to recover amounts owed from a borrower who has not responded\nsatisfactorily to the routine demands of the creditor9s billing procedures.\nAn applicant cannot be denied a Direct PLUS Loan because they have no credit history. That is, the absence of a credit\nhistory is not considered to be adverse credit.\nThere are two means by which a Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit history can still qualify for a Direct\nPLUS Loan. One option is for the applicant to obtain an endorser who doesn9t have an adverse credit history. An endorser\nis someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower doesn9t repay it. For a parent borrower, the\nendorser may not be the dependent student for whom the parent is borrowing.\nAs an alternative to obtaining an endorser, an applicant who has been determined to have an adverse credit history may\nalso qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan by submitting documentation to the Department showing that there are extenuating\ncircumstances associated with the adverse credit. The Department has the final decision on determining whether\nextenuating circumstances exist.\nA borrower who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting to the satisfaction of the\nDepartment that extenuating circumstances exist must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling, as discussed below.', 'If your school participates in the Direct PLUS program but a student9s parent cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the\nstudent is allowed to borrow additional unsubsidized funds (see <Criteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan Funds= in Chapter 4 of this volume).\nRequired Counseling for Direct PLUS Loan Applicants With Adverse Credit\nAny student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has an adverse credit history but qualifies by obtaining an endorser\nor documenting that there are extenuating circumstances must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling on the\nDepartment9s StudentAid.gov website.\nAdverse Credit History and Default\nAlthough a default on a Title IV loan will generally appear in a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant9s credit record\nand result in the individual being determined to have an adverse credit history, being in default on a Title IV loan and\nhaving an adverse credit history are separate eligibility issues. A Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified through the\nDepartment9s National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as being in default on a Title IV loan and who has also been\ndetermined to have an adverse credit history (due to the default and/or other adverse credit conditions) cannot qualify for\na Direct PLUS Loan simply by obtaining an endorser or by providing acceptable documentation of extenuating\ncircumstances. The applicant must also separately resolve the default status by one of the means discussed under\n<Resolving Default Status= in Volume 1, Chapter 3.\nIn some cases, the Direct PLUS Loan credit check may not reveal a default on a Title IV loan, particularly if the default is\nnot recent. If a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified in NSLDS as being in default on a Title IV\nloan does not have any other adverse credit issues, the applicant will pass the PLUS credit check. In this circumstance you\ncannot assume that the approved credit check result supersedes the information in NSLDS. The default must be resolved\nbefore you can disburse Direct PLUS Loan funds or other Title IV aid to the applicant.\nDirect PLUS Loan Application\nSchools that offer Direct PLUS Loans have the option of requiring student and parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants to\ncomplete the Direct PLUS Loan Application (formally known as the ""Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request for Supplemental\nInformation"") on the Department\'s StudentAid.gov website as the first step in applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. The Direct\nPLUS Loan Application collects the requested loan amount, the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended, and\nother information related to processing the requested Direct PLUS Loan.\nUse of the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov is not required. Schools may choose to develop their own\nprocesses for obtaining the information needed to originate Direct PLUS Loans.\nAlthough the Department9s FAFSA Processing System (FPS) matches student Direct PLUS Loan applicants against NSLDS\nto determine if they are in default on a Title IV loan, it does not perform this match for parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants.\nHowever, the Department conducts an NSLDS default check on all Direct PLUS Loan applicants (both students and\nparents) who complete the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov.\nSchools that use the Direct PLUS Loan Application are notified of the result of the NSLDS default check through the\nCommon Origination and Disbursement (COD) System. The result is reported as one of the following values:\n""N"" = The borrower is not in default on any Title IV loan.\nDefinition of <Adverse Credit History=\n34 CFR 685.200(c)(2)(viii)(B)\n34 CFR 685.200(b)(5)']","['Definition of <Parent= for Direct PLUS Loan Purposes If they meet all other Direct PLUS Loan eligibility requirements, the following individuals can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent undergraduate student: The student9s biological parent; The student9s legal adoptive parent; or The student9s stepparent (spouse of the student9s biological or legal adoptive parent at the time of application), but only if the stepparent is required to provide their information on the FAFSA form in accordance with the instructions on the FAFSA form. Grandparents and other family members are not eligible to take out Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent undergraduate student unless they have legally adopted the student.

- They must be the biological parent, legal adoptive parent, or stepparent of the dependent student.
- The dependent student must have filed a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form.
- The parent must not be in default on a Title IV loan or owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay.

Additionally, if a parent has an adverse credit history, they may still qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser or by documenting extenuating circumstances related to their credit issues. 

In summary, both graduate/professional students and parents of dependent undergraduate students can obtain Direct PLUS Loans, subject to specific eligibility criteria.","The following individuals can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent undergraduate student: the student's biological parent, the student's legal adoptive parent, or the student's stepparent, but only if the stepparent is required to provide their information on the FAFSA form.

"What are the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers, including those with adverse credit history, and what responsibilities do schools have in this process?","['Chapter 2\nDirect Loan Counseling\nCounseling Overview\nFirst-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a\nDirect Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled\non at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default.

Your school will receive notification through the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) (see <Required Electronic\nProcesses= in Volume 2, Chapter 3 for more information) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers, and\ncompletion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If your school documents that borrowers have\ncompleted the Department9s online counseling, it has satisfied its counseling responsibility. Documentation that a\nborrower has completed the Department9s online entrance or exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan entrance or exit\ncounseling requirements.\nYour school may also choose to provide entrance or exit counseling through an in-person session or (for entrance\ncounseling) by providing a separate written form to the student that the student signs and returns to the school. If your\nschool conducts in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions\ncan help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive\nprograms to ensure that students understand the terms and conditions of their loans.

Here’s a comprehensive overview:

### Counseling Requirements for Direct Loan Borrowers

1. **Entrance Counseling**:
   - **Who Must Complete**: All first-time student borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and student Direct PLUS Loans must complete entrance counseling before their first disbursement. Parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers are exempt from this requirement.
   - **Content Covered**: The counseling must include:
     - Explanation of the Master Promissory Note (MPN).
     - Importance of the loan repayment obligation.
     - Consequences of default, including adverse credit reports and collection procedures.
     - Obligation to repay the full loan amount regardless of program completion or employment status.
     - Sample monthly repayment amounts based on different levels of indebtedness.
     - Impact of the loan on eligibility for other financial aid.
     - Information on interest accrual and capitalization.
     - Definition of half-time enrollment and its consequences.
     - Importance of contacting the school if the borrower withdraws.

2. **Exit Counseling**:
   - Required for all Direct Loan borrowers shortly before they cease to be enrolled at least half-time.
   - Must provide information about repayment obligations and options, as well as the consequences of default.

3. **Special Requirements for Adverse Credit History**:
   - For student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers who have been determined to have an adverse credit history, there are additional counseling requirements, although specific details on these additional requirements are not provided in the context.

### Responsibilities of Schools

- **Ensure Completion**: Schools must ensure that first-time borrowers complete entrance counseling before disbursing loans. This can be done through in-person sessions, online tools, or written forms.
- **Expert Availability**: Schools must have someone knowledgeable about Title IV programs available to answer questions after counseling.
- **Documentation**: Schools must document that borrowers have completed the required counseling, which can be satisfied by using the Department’s online counseling tools.
- **Additional Counseling**: While schools cannot require additional counseling beyond what is mandated, they can encourage participation in further financial literacy programs and provide extra information as part of their counseling policy.

### Conclusion

In summary, Direct Loan borrowers must complete both entrance and exit counseling, with specific content requirements outlined for each. Schools play a crucial role in facilitating this process, ensuring compliance, and providing support to borrowers.","First-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a Direct Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis.

"How do exceptions to the normal loan period apply to Direct PLUS Loans when clinical work is involved, and what are the implications if a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passes away?","['may not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of\npayments while the student was enrolled at least half time.\nIf a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death,\nthe school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of\nthe original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent\nstudent (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4\nof this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate\na Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended.\nFor additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the\nFSA Handbook.\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term\nVolume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and\nnonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine\nweeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education\nprogram work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical\nWork in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below.\nIf clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard\nterm, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.\nIf a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the\nstarting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of\nthe clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on\nAugust 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not\nbegin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be\nthe beginning date of the term.\nIf the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a\nDirect Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the\ncase).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the\nspring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as\nSeptember 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which\nit is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term.\nIf loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the\nnormal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies,\nand the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of\na fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that\nfall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1\nthrough June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1\nthrough June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for\ninformation on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits).\nIf there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work,\nand the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to\nbegin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two\nloan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.', ""Regardless of the length of the loan period, you may disburse a Direct Loan in a single installment if the loan is to cover a\nstudent's COA in a study abroad program and your school9s calculated cohort default rate is less than 5% for the most\nrecent fiscal year for which data are available.\nDirect Loan Disbursements for Completed Payment Periods\nThe Direct Loan Program regulations allow a school to include in a single disbursement the disbursements for any\npayment periods that have ended. However, the COD System (except for schools exempted because of low default rates)\nrequires schools to enter at least two anticipated disbursement dates. Therefore, when creating a loan origination record\nfor a Direct Loan when you intend to include in a disbursement loan proceeds for any payment periods that have been\ncompleted, you should enter the actual date you anticipate making the disbursement as the anticipated date for all\ndisbursements that would be included. For example, consider a school attempting to submit an origination when the data\nis as follows:\nLoan period: 09/01 - 05/30 (fall through spring)\nMinimum number of disbursements normally required: 2\nPayment period 1: 09/01 - 12/20\nPayment period 2: 01/06 - 05/30\nDate school creates origination record: 01/09\nIf you anticipate disbursing the loan proceeds for both payment periods on January 16, you should enter January 16 as the\ndate for both the first and second disbursements when you create the origination record.\nDirect Loan Disbursements Made After the Date of the Borrower9s Death\nIf a school learns that a student or parent Direct Loan borrower has died before one or more disbursements of a loan have\nbeen made, the school must cancel all pending disbursements. Direct Loan funds cannot be disbursed when there is no\npossibility of repayment. In addition, if a school is not informed of a student or parent borrower9s death until after one or\nmore loan disbursements have been made, the school must return to the Department the full amount of all loan funds\nthat were credited to the student9s school account after the date of the borrower9s death (if the post-death disbursement\ncreated a credit balance that was paid directly to the student or parent, the school is not responsible for returning the\ncredit balance amount).\nDisbursements after the date of the borrower9s death are most likely to occur when a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower\ndies. If an enrolled student dies, the school will generally learn of the death in a timely manner and can cancel any\npending loan disbursements. However, if a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower dies, the student or other family members\nStudy Abroad Program Exception\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(6)(i)(B)\nDirect Loan Disbursement After One or More Payment Periods Have Elapsed\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(4)(i)"", 'information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form\nIf you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information\nsections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the\nstudent, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up\nto the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent\nsecond-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume\nfor information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of\nthe other Title IV programs.\nSelf-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or\nhave refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated\nstatement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students\nwithout parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide.\nDirect PLUS Loans\nDirect PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate\nstudents.\nA parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who\nmeets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a\nstudent. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is\nineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent\nwho had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements\noutlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal\ngovernment holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s\nineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student\nis otherwise eligible.\nRequirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers\nSchools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan\nProgram and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available\nto both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students. For more information, see the\ndiscussion under <Direct PLUS Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDefinition of <Parent= for Direct PLUS Loan Purposes\nIf they meet all other Direct PLUS Loan eligibility requirements, the following individuals can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on\nbehalf of a dependent undergraduate student:\nThe student9s biological parent;\nThe student9s legal adoptive parent; or\nThe student9s stepparent (spouse of the student9s biological or legal adoptive parent at the time of application), but\nonly if the stepparent is required to provide their information on the FAFSA form in accordance with the instructions\non the FAFSA form.\nGrandparents and other family members are not eligible to take out Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent\nundergraduate student unless they have legally adopted the student.\nIn addition to the parent(s) whose resources are reported on a student9s FAFSA form, any otherwise eligible biological or\nlegal adoptive parent of the dependent undergraduate student can also take out a Direct PLUS Loan on the student9s\nbehalf, even if that parent9s information is not reported on the FAFSA form.\nNote also that more than one parent can take out a Direct PLUS Loan on behalf of the same dependent undergraduate']","['<1-hop>\n\nmay not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of payments while the student was enrolled at least half time. If a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death, the school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent student (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4 of this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.', '<2-hop>\n\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and nonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","Exceptions to the normal loan period for Direct PLUS Loans apply when clinical work is involved in a student's program. If clinical work meets specific criteria to be included in a standard term or substantially equal nonstandard term, the loan period can be adjusted. For instance, if clinical work begins before the term starts, the loan period start date is set to the beginning of the clinical work rather than the term's start date. Conversely, if the clinical work ends after the term's end date, the loan period end date is adjusted to the end of the clinical work.

For example, if a fall semester runs from September 1 to December 31 and includes clinical work starting on August 15, the loan period would be reported as August 15 to December 31. Similarly, if the spring semester runs from January 1 to May 31 and includes clinical work ending on June 20, the loan period would be reported as September 1 to June 20.

Regarding the implications if a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passes away, the school must cancel any pending disbursements if they learn of the borrower's death before disbursement. If disbursements have already been made after the borrower's death, the school must return those funds to the Department of Education. If the parent borrower dies, the school may also explore options for a surviving parent to take out a new Direct PLUS Loan or award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended. 

In summary, clinical work can lead to exceptions in loan periods for Direct PLUS Loans, and if a parent borrower dies, it triggers specific actions regarding disbursements and potential new loan options for surviving family members.","Exceptions to the normal loan period apply to Direct PLUS Loans when clinical work is involved by allowing the loan period start date to be the beginning date of the clinical work if it starts before the term, and the loan period end date to be the ending date of the clinical work if it ends after the term. This adjustment ensures that the loan period accurately reflects the duration of the clinical work. In the event that a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passes away, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended. This ensures that the student can continue to receive financial aid despite the change in circumstances.",0.8,1.0,0.58,0.9194721993660865,0.571428570612245,0.23529411764705882,7.427232027053833,contextual_compression_rag
"What are the requirements for entrance counseling for first-time Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers, and how does this relate to the overall Direct Loan counseling process?","['Chapter 2\nDirect Loan Counseling\nCounseling Overview\nFirst-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a\nDirect Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled\non at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan.

This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default.

You can also reinforce messages to borrowers. For example, with each\ndisbursement you can remind students about the importance of maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP; see\nVolume 1, Chapter 1 for details on SAP requirements), planning for future employment, and staying in touch with the loan\nservicer.

### Requirements for Entrance Counseling:
1. **Definition of First-Time Borrower**: A first-time borrower is defined as someone who has not previously received a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan.

2. **Content of Counseling**: The entrance counseling must cover several key topics, including:
   - The use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN).
   - The importance of the loan repayment obligation.
   - Consequences of default, including adverse credit reports and collection procedures.
   - The borrower's obligation to repay the loan regardless of their educational outcomes.
   - Sample monthly repayment amounts based on different levels of indebtedness.
   - How accepting the loan affects eligibility for other financial aid.
   - Information on interest accrual and capitalization.
   - The option to pay interest on Direct Unsubsidized Loans while in school.
   - Definition of half-time enrollment and its importance.
   - Importance of contacting the school if the borrower withdraws.

3. **Delivery Methods**: Counseling can be conducted in various formats, including in-person sessions, written forms, or online interactive means. If conducted online, schools must ensure that students complete the counseling, which may include a test to assess understanding.

4. **Documentation and Support**: Schools must document that the student received the counseling and have someone available to answer questions afterward.

### Relation to Overall Direct Loan Counseling Process:
Entrance counseling is part of a broader Direct Loan counseling process that also includes exit counseling, which is required for all Direct Loan borrowers before they cease enrollment at least half-time. While schools cannot require additional counseling beyond entrance counseling, they can encourage participation in further financial literacy programs and provide additional resources to help students understand their borrowing and repayment responsibilities.

In summary, entrance counseling is a critical step for first-time Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers, ensuring they are informed about their loans and responsibilities before receiving funds.","Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers. This counseling provides comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan and the borrower's responsibility to repay it. It can be conducted in-person, through written forms, or online, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. Schools must ensure that students complete the counseling, which may include a test of their understanding. This requirement is part of the broader Direct Loan counseling process, which also includes exit counseling for all student Direct Loan borrowers before they cease to be enrolled at least half-time. The overall process ensures that borrowers are informed about their loans and responsibilities, aligning with the school's responsibilities to guide students through their financial aid options.",1.0,1.0,0.46,0.9592861854206531,0.49999999916666665,0.5,9.113883972167969,contextual_compression_rag
How do student loan eligibility criteria and minimum loan periods interact when a student is ineligible for a term within a fall-winter-spring academic year?,"['period are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be\nenrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and\nspring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be\nenrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering\nthe fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s\nCOA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a\nschool initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of\nat least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily\ndrops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not\nrequired to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school\nto adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and\nspring quarters only.\nIn the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-\nonly loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring\nloan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would\nthen be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining\nthe student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods\nOther Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a\nstudent9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs\nassociated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the\nfall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine\nmonths.\nThe limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last\nterms within the loan period.

However, programs with non-SE9W nonstandard terms are\ntreated the same as non-term programs for these purposes.\nNote that substantially equal nonstandard terms (the first two types of nonstandard terms described above) are treated\ndifferently for purposes of determining Direct Loan payment periods than for determining minimum loan period length\nand monitoring annual loan limits. As explained in Volume 1, Chapter 1, if a program is offered in standard terms or in\nnonstandard terms that are substantially equal in length (regardless of the length of the nonstandard term), the payment\nperiod is the term.\nHowever, for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and monitoring Direct Loan annual loan\nlimits, substantially equal nonstandard terms that contain fewer than nine weeks are treated the same as nonstandard\nterms that are not substantially equal. This means that if a program has substantially equal nonstandard terms that are\nless than nine weeks in length, you must make a Direct Loan disbursement each term (the same as would be the case if\nthe program were offered in standard terms), but the minimum loan period and the type of academic year used to\nmonitor Direct Loan annual loan limits must be determined in accordance with the rules that apply to non-term programs.\nFor detailed information on standard term, nonstandard term, and non-term programs, see Volume 1, Chapter 1.\nMinimum Loan Period: Standard Term and SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\nFor credit-hour programs with standard terms (semesters, quarters, or trimesters), or with SE9W\nnonstandard terms, the minimum loan period is a single academic term. For example, if a student will be enrolled in the\nfall semester only and will skip the spring semester, you may originate a loan with a loan period that covers only the fall\nterm.\nMinimum Loan Period: Clock-Hour, Non-Term, and Non-SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\nFor all other programs (i.e., clock-hour, non-term, and non-SE9W nonstandard term programs), the minimum\nloan period is generally the lesser of the program length (or remainder of the program, if there is less than full academic\nyear remaining) or the academic year. There are exceptions to this minimum loan period rule when originating loans for\ntransfer students, or for students who complete or otherwise cease enrollment in one program and then begin a different\nprogram at the same school. We discuss these exceptions in detail in Chapter 7 of this volume.\nMinimum Loan Period: Programs Offered in Modules\nIf a program is offered in modules, this does not change the minimum loan period rules for Direct Loans. For example, if a\nstandard or SE9W nonstandard term is divided into two or more modules, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is\nstill the term, even if the student does not attend all modules within the term. Similarly, if a clock-hour, non-term credit-\nMinimum Loan Period\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(10)(i)']","['<1-hop>\n\nperiod are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and spring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be enrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering the fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s COA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a school initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of at least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily drops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not required to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school to adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and spring quarters only. In the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring- only loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring loan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would then be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining the student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods Other Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a student9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs associated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the fall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months. The limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last terms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period. For instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall term or the spring term.

Nonstandard terms may be one of the following types: 1. Nonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any other term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length.

1. **Loan Period Origination**: A school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering the fall, winter, and spring quarters even if the student is ineligible for the winter quarter (e.g., not attending or enrolled less than half-time). However, costs associated with the winter quarter cannot be included in the calculation of the loan amount for the fall and spring quarters.

2. **Adjustments to Loan Amounts**: If a student initially qualifies for a loan covering all three quarters but later becomes ineligible for the winter quarter, the school is not required to change the original loan period. However, it may need to adjust the loan amount based on the costs for the fall and spring quarters only, as the winter quarter costs are excluded.

3. **Separate Loan Options**: The school has the option to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-only periods if the student is ineligible for the winter quarter. In this case, the school must subtract the student's full Student Aid Index (SAI) from the costs of the fall and spring terms when determining eligibility for Direct Subsidized Loans.

4. **Proration of Loan Limits**: If a student is enrolled less than half-time during the ineligible term, the loan period may be adjusted to cover only the eligible terms. For example, if a student is enrolled full-time in the fall and less than half-time in the winter, the loan period may only cover the fall quarter, leading to a prorated annual loan limit based on the hours enrolled.

5. **Eligibility Criteria**: Importantly, the limited exception for loan origination applies only if the student is eligible for Direct Loans during the first and last terms of the loan period. If the student is ineligible for either the fall or spring term, the school cannot originate a loan for that period.

In summary, while a student can still receive loans for the fall and spring quarters despite being ineligible for the winter quarter, the school must carefully consider the costs and eligibility criteria when determining the loan amount and whether to adjust the loan period.","Student loan eligibility criteria allow a school to originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring period even if a student is ineligible for one of the terms, such as the winter quarter, provided the student is eligible during the first and last terms of the loan period. However, no costs associated with the ineligible term can be included in the student's Cost of Attendance (COA) when determining the loan amount. The minimum loan period for originating a Direct Loan depends on the school's academic calendar and whether the program is term-based or non-term. For term-based programs with nonstandard terms, the terms must be substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length. This interaction ensures that while students can receive loans for eligible terms, the loan amounts must be adjusted to reflect only the periods of eligibility, adhering to the minimum loan period requirements.",1.0,1.0,0.64,0.9515255467129039,0.1999999998,0.42857142857142855,10.44812297821045,contextual_compression_rag
"How does proration apply to students in clock-hour programs when their remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year, and what are some examples of this proration process?","['Graduate Early From a Clock-Hour Program= later in this chapter).\nIn a standard-term program, or a credit-hour program using SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of\nstudy is considered shorter than an academic year if the remaining period contains fewer terms than the number of terms\ncovered by the school9s Title IV academic year. For programs that are offered in a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY; see\nChapter 6), the number of terms covered in the school9s Title IV academic year usually does not include a summer\n<header= or <trailer= term.\nConsider a student who is enrolled in a four-year program that is offered in an SAY consisting of three quarters plus a\nsummer trailer, and who has completed four academic years of study. The student needs to attend an additional quarter\nterm to complete the program requirements. The final quarter term falls in a new academic year; therefore the annual\nloan limit must be prorated because the remaining period of study (a single quarter) is less than a full academic year.\nSimilarly, if a student enrolled in a two-year program not offered in an SAY (where the Title IV academic year covers two\n15-week semesters) has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to\ncomplete the program requirements, the loan limit must be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester.\nNote that for standard-term programs or credit-hour programs with SE9W nonstandard terms, the length of the loan\nperiod does not determine whether a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic\nyear. The determining factor is the length of the remaining period of study in which the student is enrolled, which may not\nbe the same as the loan period. For example, if an undergraduate student is enrolled for a full SAY consisting of fall and\nspring semesters, and will complete the program at the end of the spring term, but is enrolled less than half time during\nthe spring, the student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan only for the fall semester. Although the loan period (fall only) is\nshorter than an academic year, the remaining period of study (fall through spring) is a full academic year. Therefore, if the\nstudent receives a Direct Loan in the fall, proration of the annual loan limit is not required.\nIn a clock-hour program, non-term program, or a program with non-SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining\nperiod of study is considered less than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program9s\ndefined Title IV academic year. In contrast to standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, if a student enrolled\nin a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is in a remaining period of study shorter than an\nacademic year and receives a Direct Loan, the loan period and the remaining period of study will always be the same. This\nis because for these programs the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program (or remaining portion of\na program) or the academic year.\nFor all types of programs, you determine the prorated loan limit for a student enrolled in a remaining period of study less\nthan an academic year by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by the following fraction:\nUnlike proration for programs that are shorter than an academic year, there is no comparison of weeks and hours.

Loan proration requirements also do not apply to students taking preparatory coursework or coursework\nnecessary for teacher certification. This is because the annual loan limit must be prorated only when a student is enrolled\nin a program or remaining portion of a program that is shorter than an academic year. Students taking preparatory\ncoursework or teacher certification coursework are not considered to be enrolled in a program for purposes of awarding\nTitle IV aid.\nIt9s important to understand that loan limit proration determines the maximum loan amount that a student may borrow\nfor a program or remaining balance of a program, not the actual loan amount a student is eligible to receive. In some\ncases, the loan amount a student is eligible to receive (based on costs, SAI, and OFA) may be less than the prorated loan\nlimit.\nUse of Fractions vs. Decimals When Prorating Loan Limits\nAs we explain in more detail below, proration involves multiplying the annual loan limit by a fraction. You may choose to\nconvert the fraction to a decimal and then multiply the annual loan limit by the decimal, but this conversion is not a\nrequirement. However, you should be consistent in the method you use, since the fraction and decimal calculations\nsometimes result in slightly different prorated loan limits, as shown in the examples later in the chapter.\nUsing the School9s Academic Year Definition If Longer Than the Title IV Minimum\nAs explained above, proration of the annual loan limit is required when an undergraduate student is enrolled in a program\nthat is shorter than an academic year or is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year.\nA school may choose to define its academic year as longer in weeks or hours than the minimum statutory requirements. If\nso, the school9s standard 3 not the statutory minimum 3 determines whether a program or a final period of study is shorter\nthan an academic year.\nSeparate Calculations for the Combined Subsidized and Unsubsidized Annual Loan Limit and the Maximum Subsidized\nLoan Limit Proration\n34 CFR 685.203(a), (b), (c)', 'Prorating Loan Limits for Remaining Periods Shorter Than an Academic Year\nYou must also prorate loan limits for students enrolled in remaining periods of study shorter than an academic year. This\ncircumstance can occur when a student is enrolled in a program that is one academic year or more in length, but the\nremaining period of study needed to complete the program (sometimes called a <final= period of study) will be shorter\nthan an academic year.\nProration is required only when you know in advance that a student will be enrolled for a remaining period of study that is\nshorter than an academic year. With one exception, if a student originally enrolls for a remaining period of study that is a\nfull academic year in length, but completes the program in less than a full academic year, there is no requirement to\nretroactively prorate the annual loan limit (for the exception, see <Proration of the Annual Loan Limit for Students Who\nTo determine the maximum portion of the $2,420 prorated annual loan limit that the student may receive in\nsubsidized loan funds, multiply the maximum subsidized annual loan limit of $3,500 by the smaller decimal\n(0.44):\n$3,500 x 0.44 = $1,540 subsidized prorated annual loan limit\nThe maximum combined Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount the student can borrow for\nthe program is $2,420, but no more than $1,540 of this amount may be in subsidized loans.\nNote: In Example 1 above and in the other proration examples that follow, the fractions are converted to\ndecimals. As an alternative you could choose to multiply the annual loan limit by the original fraction, though you\nshould be consistent in using one method or the other. Using the fraction 400/900 in Example 1 instead of the\ndecimal 0.44 would result in a slightly higher prorated loan limit: $5,500 x 400/900 = $2,444.\nVolume 8, Chapter 5, Example 2: Non-Term Credit-Hour Program Shorter Than an Academic Year\nAn independent student is enrolled in a 24 quarter-hour, 20-week program.

In a standard-term program, or a credit-hour program using SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of study is considered shorter than an academic year if the remaining period contains fewer terms than the number of terms covered by the school9s Title IV academic year. For programs that are offered in a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY; see Chapter 6), the number of terms covered in the school9s Title IV academic year usually does not include a summer <header= or <trailer= term. Consider a student who is enrolled in a four-year program that is offered in an SAY consisting of three quarters plus a summer trailer, and who has completed four academic years of study. The student needs to attend an additional quarter term to complete the program requirements. The final quarter term falls in a new academic year; therefore the annual loan limit must be prorated because the remaining period of study (a single quarter) is less than a full academic year. Similarly, if a student enrolled in a two-year program not offered in an SAY (where the Title IV academic year covers two 15-week semesters) has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to complete the program requirements, the loan limit must be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester. Note that for standard-term programs or credit-hour programs with SE9W nonstandard terms, the length of the loan period does not determine whether a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year. The determining factor is the length of the remaining period of study in which the student is enrolled, which may not be the same as the loan period. For example, if an undergraduate student is enrolled for a full SAY consisting of fall and spring semesters, and will complete the program at the end of the spring term, but is enrolled less than half time during the spring, the student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan only for the fall semester. Although the loan period (fall only) is shorter than an academic year, the remaining period of study (fall through spring) is a full academic year. Therefore, if the student receives a Direct Loan in the fall, proration of the annual loan limit is not required. In a clock-hour program, non-term program, or a program with non-SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of study is considered less than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program9s defined Title IV academic year. In contrast to standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, if a student enrolled in a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is in a remaining period of study shorter than an academic year and receives a Direct Loan, the loan period and the remaining period of study will always be the same. This is because for these programs the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program (or remaining portion of a program) or the academic year. For all types of programs, you determine the prorated loan limit for a student enrolled in a remaining period of study less than an academic year by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by the following fraction: Unlike proration for programs that are shorter than an academic year, there is no comparison of weeks and hours. Only the credit or clock hours that the student is scheduled to attend, or is actually attending, at the time of origination are used in the calculation.', '<2-hop>\n\nProration Examples: Remaining Periods of Study Shorter Than an Academic Year Examples 3 through 7 illustrate how the prorated annual loan limit is determined when a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study shorter than an academic year. Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours enrolled in program Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours in academic year Volume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3: Remaining Period = One Quarter']","Proration applies to students in clock-hour programs when their remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year by reducing the annual loan limit based on the length of the remaining study period. This is necessary to ensure that the loan amount corresponds to the actual time and coursework the student has left to complete their program.

In clock-hour programs, a remaining period of study is considered shorter than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program's defined Title IV academic year. The proration process involves calculating the maximum loan amount a student can borrow by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by a fraction that represents the ratio of the hours the student is scheduled to attend to the hours in the academic year.

### Examples of the Proration Process:

1. **Example of a Student in a Clock-Hour Program**:
   - Suppose a student is enrolled in a clock-hour program that requires 900 clock hours for completion, and the school defines the academic year as 900 clock hours. If the student has completed 600 clock hours and has 300 clock hours remaining, the remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year.
   - The proration fraction would be calculated as:
     - Remaining hours (300) / Academic year hours (900) = 1/3 or approximately 0.33.
   - If the annual loan limit for the program is $4,500, the prorated loan limit would be:
     - $4,500 x 0.33 = $1,485.

2. **Example of a Non-Term Credit-Hour Program**:
   - An independent student is enrolled in a 24 quarter-hour, 20-week program, while the school defines the academic year as 36 quarter hours and 30 weeks of instructional time.
   - The fractions for weeks and hours would be:
     - 20 weeks in program / 30 weeks in academic year = 0.67
     - 24 hours in program / 36 hours in academic year = 0.67
   - The combined Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual limit for a first-year independent undergraduate is $9,500. The prorated annual loan limit would be:
     - $9,500 x 0.67 = $6,365.
   - For subsidized loans, the maximum portion would be:
     - $3,500 x 0.67 = $2,345.

These examples illustrate how proration is calculated based on the remaining study period in relation to the defined academic year, ensuring that students receive loan amounts that accurately reflect their educational progress and needs.","In clock-hour programs, if a student's remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year, the loan limit must be prorated. This is because the remaining period consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program's defined Title IV academic year. Unlike standard-term programs, the loan period and the remaining period of study in clock-hour programs will always be the same, as the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program or the academic year. Proration is determined by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by a fraction based on the credit or clock hours the student is scheduled to attend. Examples of this proration process include scenarios where a student is enrolled in a remaining period of one quarter, as illustrated in Volume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3.",1.0,1.0,0.48,0.9457163688775488,0.3333333329629629,0.05263157894736842,9.63162088394165,contextual_compression_rag

Not more than $65,500 of this\namount may be from subsidized loans (see the notes following Table 4 above regarding the $65,500 subsidized aggregate\nloan limit for graduate and professional students).\nIf a student who received increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts for a qualifying health profession program later\nenrolls in a non-health professions program, the student is no longer eligible for the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan\nlimits. However, the additional loan amounts received for the health professions program are not counted toward the\nnormal aggregate loan limit for that student.\nChecking Remaining Eligibility Under the Aggregate Loan Limits\nBefore originating a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, it9s important to make sure the student still has\nremaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limits. As long as there is no conflicting information, you may rely on the\nfinancial aid history (provided on the ISIR as well as on the NSLDS Professional Access website) and the Transfer Student\nMonitoring process (for transfer students only) to tell you if a student is about to exceed the applicable aggregate loan\nlimit. (See Volume 1, Chapter 3 for more detail on NSLDS financial aid history, which may also affect eligibility for other\nTitle IV programs.)\nThe Loan History in NSLDS for a borrower who has received Title IV loans shows Aggregate Loan Information for the\nborrower9s outstanding subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding\nPrincipal Balance amounts shown for a borrower in NSLDS do not include unpaid accrued interest, capitalized interest\n(unpaid interest that has been added to the principal balance of the loan), or other charges, as these amounts are not\ncounted against the aggregate loan limits.\nFor each individual loan that a borrower has received, NSLDS shows both the Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) and the\nAggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). The OPB is what the borrower owes, which may include capitalized\ninterest and other charges. The Agg. OPB is the portion of the OPB that counts against the aggregate loan limits for\nsubsidized and unsubsidized loans.\nFor instance, suppose a student has a Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursed in the amount of $5,000. Over time, $200 in\ninterest accrues and is capitalized. Assuming that the borrower has made no payments on the loan, the OPB on the loan\nwill be $5,200 (this is the amount the borrower owes), and the Agg. OPB will be $5,000 (this is the amount that is counted\nagainst the aggregate loan limit). If you are looking at information in NSLDS for individual loans, it is the Agg. OPB that\nyou should use to determine the student9s remaining loan eligibility under the applicable aggregate loan limit.\nThe Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance amounts displayed in NSLDS for a borrower\nalso include the outstanding portion of consolidation loans (both Direct Consolidation Loans and Federal Consolidation\nLoans made under the FFEL program) attributable to Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Subsidized\nFederal Stafford Loans, and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans that were repaid by the consolidation loan.\nUnallocated Consolidation Loan Amounts\nNSLDS may also show a <Consolidation Loans, Unallocated= amount that is not counted against a borrower9s aggregate\nloan limits. The <Consolidation Loans, Unallocated= amount represents the portion of a consolidation loan that cannot be\nattributed to other loans in the borrower9s loan history. For example, it may represent capitalized interest or non-Title IV\nloans that were consolidated. You are not responsible for determining the origin of any unallocated consolidation loan\namounts.\nTreatment of Consolidated Perkins Loans and PLUS Loans\nA consolidated Perkins Loan or PLUS loan becomes part of the unsubsidized portion of a consolidation loan, but it is not', 'Chapter 3\nDirect Loan Origination, Loan Periods, and Disbursements\nOrigination Overview\nOrigination is the process of creating a Direct Loan award in the school9s system. Before originating a Direct Loan, a\nschool must determine the student9s or parent9s eligibility for the loan. For each Direct Loan that a school disburses to a\nstudent or parent, the school must submit a loan award record to the COD System that includes the student9s grade level,\nthe loan period and academic year dates, the loan amount, the anticipated and actual dates and amounts of the loan\ndisbursements, and other information. Submission of a loan award record serves as the school9s certification that it has\ndetermined the borrower9s eligibility for the loan.\nThe specific Direct Loan amount that a student or parent borrower is eligible to receive is determined based on various\nfactors such as the student9s COA, Student Aid Index (SAI), OFA, and remaining eligibility under the annual and aggregate\nloan limits (see Chapter 4 for guidance on annual and aggregate loan limits). Some of these factors are relevant only\nwhen determining eligibility for certain types of Direct Loans. When originating a Direct Loan, the COA used in\ndetermining the loan amount may include only those costs associated with the period of enrollment (loan period) for\nwhich the loan is being originated.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans have annual and aggregate limits that are the same for all\nstudents at a given grade level and dependency status. You may not originate a Direct Loan for an amount that:\nExceeds the amount requested by the borrower;\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus the student9s SAI and OFA;\nIn the case of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan or Direct PLUS Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus OFA; or\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, would cause the student to exceed the annual or\naggregate limit.\nSee Volume 3, Chapter 3 for more information on packaging Direct Loans as part of a student9s financial aid award.\nOriginating a Loan\nIt9s important to remember that your school, not the Department, is responsible for determining a borrower9s eligibility for\na Direct Loan. Schools that originate and disburse loans to ineligible borrowers, or for loan amounts that exceed loan\nlimits or financial need, are subject to administrative actions such as a fine, limitation, suspension, and termination, as\nwell as liabilities including repayment to the government of interest and costs it has paid on the ineligible loans.\nYou must originate a Direct Loan while the student is enrolled and eligible for the period of enrollment for which the loan\nis intended. You may not originate a loan for a period in which the student is no longer enrolled. For example, you may\nnot originate a loan for a prior academic year that has ended, even if the student is enrolled and eligible for the current\nacademic year. Similarly, if a student who was enrolled at least half time only for the fall and spring quarters of an\nacademic year consisting of fall, winter, and spring quarters does not request a loan until the spring, you may not at that\ntime originate a loan for the previous fall quarter.\nFor all Direct Loans, you must document the student9s COA, SAI, and OFA in the student9s file. This information must be\nmade available to the Department upon request.\nYou must confirm that the borrower meets the definition of eligible borrower by doing the following:\nDetermine that the student is enrolled at least half time and making satisfactory academic progress (see Volume 1);\nReview the NSLDS information on the ISIR or the NSLDS Professional Access website to ensure that the student is not\nin default, does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant or loan (see Volume 1), and will not exceed the annual or\naggregate loan limits (as described in Chapter 4 of this volume);\nEnsure that the amount of the loan, in combination with other aid, will not exceed the student9s financial need or', ""Graduate program in Public Health (including Master's and Doctoral\ndegree programs in Public Health)\nCouncil on Education for Public Health\nDoctor of Chiropractic\nCouncil on Chiropractic Education, Commission\non Accreditation\nDoctoral Degree in Clinical Psychology\nAmerican Psychological Association,\nCommittee on Accreditation\nMaster's or Doctoral Degree in Health Administration\nCommission on Accreditation of Healthcare\nManagement Education\nThe increased unsubsidized amounts that an eligible health professions student may receive are in addition to the regular\n$20,500 Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual loan limit for graduate and professional students. For example, a student\nenrolled in a nine-month Doctor of Dentistry program is eligible for the regular Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual maximum\nfor a graduate or professional student ($20,500), plus the maximum increased unsubsidized amount of $20,000, for a\ntotal Direct Unsubsidized Loan maximum of $40,500 per academic year.\nGraduate and professional students who qualify for the higher annual Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits are also eligible for\na higher combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit, as explained later in this chapter.\nProration of the Increased Health Professions Annual Loan Limit for an Academic Year Covering 10 or 11 Months\nTables 3A and 3B above show the increased unsubsidized loan limits for programs with an academic year of either nine\nmonths or 12 months. For eligible health professions programs with an academic year covering 10 or 11 months, the\nannual additional unsubsidized loan limit must be prorated. If the academic year covers 10 or 11 months, the prorated\nannual loan limit is determined by dividing the applicable loan limit for an academic year covering nine months by nine,\nand then multiplying the result by 10 or 11. For example, the prorated increased unsubsidized loan limit for a Doctor of\nDentistry program with an 11-month academic year would be $24,444, calculated as follows:\n$20,000 ÷ 9 = $2,222.22\n$2,222.22 x 11 = $24,444.42, rounded to $24,444\nForeign Schools May Not Award Increased Unsubsidized Loan Amounts\nForeign schools that participate in the Direct Loan Program may not award the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan\namounts to health professions students.\nAggregate Loan Limit Overview\nAs explained earlier in this chapter, there are limits on the maximum Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan\namounts that a student may receive each academic year (annual loan limits). There are also limits on a student9s\nmaximum outstanding total Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan debt. These are called aggregate loan\nlimits. A borrower who has reached the aggregate borrowing limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized\nLoans may not receive additional loans. Once the loans are repaid, in full or in part, the borrower may apply for additional\nloans.\nTo ensure that a student doesn9t exceed the aggregate loan limits, the student9s FAFSA form data is matched with NSLDS.\nIf the student has exceeded or is approaching the aggregate loan limits, this will be noted in the ISIR. If a student\ntransfers to your school, you must inform NSLDS so that it can begin the Transfer Student Monitoring process.\nAggregate Loan Limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\nThe aggregate loan limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are shown in Table 4 below.""]","[""<1-hop>\n\nprovided by those companies are already offered free of charge through the Department or the borrower's loan servicer; Provide a general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers (i.e. student loan interest deduction); and Require the borrower to provide current information concerning their name, address, Social Security number, references, and driver9s license number and state of issuance, as well as the borrower9s expected permanent address, the address of their next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower9s expected employer, if known (see also < Providing Borrower Information at Separation= below).

Treatment of Consolidated Perkins Loans and PLUS Loans A consolidated Perkins Loan or PLUS loan becomes part of the unsubsidized portion of a consolidation loan, but it is not']","The National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) plays a crucial role in managing borrower information and loan limits, particularly concerning unallocated consolidation loan amounts. Here’s how it assists in this process:

1. **Loan History Tracking**: NSLDS provides a comprehensive loan history for borrowers, displaying both the Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) and the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). The OPB reflects the total amount owed, including capitalized interest and other charges, while the Agg. OPB indicates the portion that counts against the aggregate loan limits for subsidized and unsubsidized loans.

2. **Aggregate Loan Limits**: The system helps ensure that borrowers do not exceed their aggregate loan limits. It shows the Aggregate Loan Information for a borrower’s outstanding subsidized and unsubsidized loans, which is essential for determining remaining eligibility under these limits. For example, if a borrower has a Direct Unsubsidized Loan of $5,000 with $200 in capitalized interest, the Agg. OPB would still be $5,000, which is the amount counted against the aggregate limit.

3. **Unallocated Consolidation Loan Amounts**: NSLDS may display a ""Consolidation Loans, Unallocated"" amount, which represents portions of a consolidation loan that cannot be attributed to other loans in the borrower’s history. This amount does not count against the borrower’s aggregate loan limits. For instance, if a consolidation loan includes capitalized interest or non-Title IV loans, these amounts would be classified as unallocated and would not affect the borrower's eligibility for future loans.

4. **Monitoring and Compliance**: Schools can rely on the financial aid history provided by NSLDS to verify a student’s eligibility for loans and ensure compliance with federal regulations. This includes checking for any conflicting information that might indicate a borrower is approaching or has exceeded their aggregate loan limits.

In summary, NSLDS assists in managing borrower information and loan limits by providing detailed loan histories, tracking aggregate loan limits, and clarifying the treatment of unallocated consolidation loan amounts, thereby ensuring that borrowers remain compliant with federal loan regulations.","The NSLDS system assists in managing borrower information by providing loan holders with the necessary data during the exit counseling process, as part of the Department's online counseling services.

There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.']","[""<1-hop>\n\nprovided by those companies are already offered free of charge through the Department or the borrower's loan servicer; Provide a general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers (i.e. student loan interest deduction); and Require the borrower to provide current information concerning their name, address, Social Security number, references, and driver9s license number and state of issuance, as well as the borrower9s expected permanent address, the address of their next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower9s expected employer, if known (see also < Providing Borrower Information at Separation= below).

If the student agrees to accept the unsubsidized loan funds and they also received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the same loan period as the Direct Subsidized Loan, you may increase the amount of the Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursements by the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. If the student did not receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you may originate a new Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. The new Direct Unsubsidized Loan must have the same loan period and disbursement dates as the Direct Subsidized Loan. If the student does not agree to have the excess subsidized loan funds replaced by a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must still return the ineligible Direct Subsidized Loan amount. If you discover that a student received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of financial need after the student is no longer enrolled for the loan period, you are not required to take any action to eliminate the excess subsidized loan amount. If you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower who was eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan instead received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must correct the error (even if the loan period has ended) by submitting a downward adjustment to reduce or eliminate the Direct Unsubsidized Loan, as appropriate, and replacing it with the same amount of Direct Subsidized Loan funds. You may do this either by adjusting an existing Direct Subsidized Loan upwards, or, if the student does not have an existing Direct Subsidized Loan, by originating a new Direct Subsidized Loan. Replacing a Direct Unsubsidized Loan with a Direct Subsidized Loan in this circumstance does not require obtaining the student9s consent. Direct Loan Overawards As explained in Volume 4, Chapter 3, an overaward exists when a student9s aid package exceeds their need or overall COA. If you discover that a student who received Direct Loans has been overawarded and your school has already received and disbursed some or all of the Direct Loan funds, you have the following options: If the student9s aid package includes a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, or a nonfederal education loan, and the aid package doesn9t already apply these loans toward the student9s SAI, you may choose to adjust the aid package to have all or a portion of these loans replace the SAI, thus reducing or eliminating the overaward (for more detail and examples, see <Substituting for the SAI= in Volume 3, Chapter 3). If you have not yet made the second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan, you can reduce or cancel the second or subsequent disbursement. If the overaward situation occurs after the full amount of a Direct Loan has been disbursed, you do not need to adjust the amount of the loan. However, you might have to adjust the aid package to prevent an overaward of Campus-Based funds or to prevent the total aid package from exceeding the student9s need. Although a school isn9t required to return Direct Loan funds that were disbursed to the borrower (either directly or by applying them to the student's account) before the overaward situation occurred, the law doesn9t prevent your school from returning funds that were applied to the student account if you choose to do so. A borrower who receives a direct payment of loan funds is not required to repay an overawarded amount, unless the overaward was caused by the borrower9s misreporting or withholding of information.""]","The Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) facilitates compliance with Direct Loan exit counseling requirements by providing schools with notifications of online loan counseling completed by borrowers. When students complete their exit counseling through the Department's StudentAid.gov website, the completion information is sent to the school via SAIG. This allows schools to document that borrowers have fulfilled their exit counseling obligations, thereby satisfying the school's responsibility to ensure compliance with the counseling requirements.

If a student receives excess Direct Subsidized Loan funds, the context does not provide specific actions to take in that situation. Therefore, it is unclear what steps should be followed regarding excess funds. Generally, students may need to contact their loan servicer or the financial aid office at their school for guidance on how to handle excess loan funds, but this specific information is not included in the provided context.","The Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) facilitates compliance with Direct Loan exit counseling requirements by notifying schools of online loan counseling completed by borrowers. This ensures that schools are aware of students fulfilling their counseling responsibilities, as completion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If a student receives excess Direct Subsidized Loan funds, the school must return the ineligible amount if the student is still enrolled. The student can choose to replace the excess subsidized funds with a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. If the student agrees, the school may increase the Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursements or originate a new one for the same loan period. If the student does not agree, the excess subsidized loan amount must still be returned.",0.3333333333333333,0.8,0.24,0.0,0.8333333319444445,0.4,4.164480686187744,contextual_compression_rag
How does the FSA Handbook guide schools in handling loan adjustments for clinical work and the death of a Title IV aid recipient?,"['may not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of\npayments while the student was enrolled at least half time.\nIf a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death,\nthe school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of\nthe original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent\nstudent (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4\nof this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate\na Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended.\nFor additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the\nFSA Handbook.\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term\nVolume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and\nnonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine\nweeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education\nprogram work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical\nWork in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below.\nIf clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard\nterm, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.\nIf a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the\nstarting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of\nthe clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on\nAugust 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not\nbegin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be\nthe beginning date of the term.\nIf the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a\nDirect Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the\ncase).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the\nspring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as\nSeptember 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which\nit is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term.\nIf loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the\nnormal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies,\nand the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of\na fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that\nfall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1\nthrough June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1\nthrough June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for\ninformation on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits).\nIf there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work,\nand the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to\nbegin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two\nloan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.', 'Volume 8\nThe Direct Loan Program\nIntroduction\nUnder the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loan Program), the U.S. Department of Education (the\nDepartment) makes loans to help students and parents pay the cost of attendance (COA) at a postsecondary school. This\nvolume of the Federal Student Aid Handbook provides information to assist schools in determining student and parent\neligibility for Direct Loans, counseling student borrowers, and awarding Direct Loans.\nChanges for 2025-2026\nWe have made the following changes in Volume 8 for 2025-2026:\nIn Chapter 3, we have revised the discussion of loan periods to provide a limited exception to the longstanding\nrequirement that the loan period for a Direct Loan may not include any terms in which the borrower is ineligible to\nreceive Direct Loan funds.\nAlso in Chapter 3, we have added a slightly revised and expanded version of guidance on the treatment of Direct\nLoan disbursements made after the date of a borrower9s death that was previously in Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the FSA\nHandbook under the heading <Checking Eligibility at the Time of Disbursement.= Because this guidance is specific to\nDirect Loans, we believe Volume 8 is a more appropriate location.\nIn Chapter 5, we have revised Example 6 to reflect the limited exception to the requirement that a loan period may\nnot include terms in which the borrower is ineligible (see Chapter 3 changes above).\nIn Chapter 7, we have revised the discussion of transfer students and abbreviated loan periods to clarify that in some\ncircumstances a transfer student may be eligible to receive more Direct Loan funds for the program at the new\nschool than a non-transfer student would be eligible to receive for that same program.\nExcept as noted above, there are no other substantive changes to Volume 8 for 2025-2026.', ""provided by those companies are already offered free of charge through the Department or the borrower's loan\nservicer;\nProvide a general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers (i.e. student loan\ninterest deduction); and\nRequire the borrower to provide current information concerning their name, address, Social Security number,\nreferences, and driver9s license number and state of issuance, as well as the borrower9s expected permanent\naddress, the address of their next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower9s expected employer, if known\n(see also <Providing Borrower Information at Separation= below).\nAs stated above, Direct Loan exit counseling must provide borrowers with the information the Department makes\navailable in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA. This section of the law requires the Department to make available\nto postsecondary schools and other entities a wide variety of information about federal student assistance programs,\nincluding information to help students assess the debt burden and repayment obligations that will be incurred as a result\nof receiving Title IV loans. As noted below under <Counseling Methods,= documentation that a borrower has completed the\nDepartment9s online exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan exit counseling requirements. Schools that choose to\nconduct their own exit counseling can meet the requirement to provide borrowers with the information made available by\nthe Department in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA by providing borrowers with a copy of the Department9s\nDirect Loan Exit Counseling Guide.\nProviding Borrower Information at Separation\nSchools that conduct their own exit counseling must provide the current personal information collected from the student\n(name, address, references, etc.) to students9 loan servicers within 60 days. Students authorize their school to release\ninformation to servicers in the loan promissory note they signed. No further permission is needed.\nStudents who complete online exit counseling on the Department9s StudentAid.gov website fulfill this requirement as part\nof the counseling session; NSLDS provides the information to the loan holders.\nCounseling Methods\nThe Department offers Direct Loan Program online entrance and exit counseling for students on the StudentAid.gov\nwebsite. Your school will receive notification through the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) (see <Required Electronic\nProcesses= in Volume 2, Chapter 3 for more information) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers, and\ncompletion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If your school documents that borrowers have\ncompleted the Department9s online counseling, it has satisfied its counseling responsibility. Documentation that a\nborrower has completed the Department9s online entrance or exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan entrance or exit\ncounseling requirements.\nYour school may also choose to provide entrance or exit counseling through an in-person session or (for entrance\ncounseling) by providing a separate written form to the student that the student signs and returns to the school. If your\nschool conducts in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions\ncan help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive\nprograms to ensure that students understand the terms and conditions of their loans. Counseling materials, such as the\nentrance and exit counseling guides, are available in the Financial Aid Toolkit.\nA school may adopt an alternative approach for entrance counseling as a part of its quality assurance plan.

If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","The FSA Handbook provides specific guidance for schools on handling loan adjustments in two key situations: when a Title IV aid recipient dies and when clinical work is involved in the loan period.

1. **Handling Loan Adjustments for the Death of a Title IV Aid Recipient**:
   - If a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan dies, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a new Direct PLUS Loan to cover the amount that needs to be returned. If this is not possible, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, up to the amounts typically available to independent undergraduates.
   - Notably, schools can originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For further actions required when a Title IV aid recipient dies, schools are directed to refer to Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.

2. **Loan Adjustments Related to Clinical Work**:
   - The Handbook outlines that if clinical work is included in a standard term or a substantially equal nonstandard term (at least nine weeks long), it may lead to exceptions in the normal loan period and disbursement rules. 
   - For instance, if clinical work begins before the term starts, the loan period start date is adjusted to the beginning of the clinical work. Conversely, if the clinical work ends after the term's end date, the loan period end date is adjusted to the end of the clinical work.
   - Schools must report the adjusted loan period dates accordingly, ensuring that the academic year period and payment period dates are also aligned with these adjustments.

These guidelines ensure that schools manage loan disbursements appropriately in the event of a borrower’s death and when clinical work impacts the academic calendar.","The FSA Handbook provides guidance for schools on handling loan adjustments in two specific scenarios. Firstly, when a Title IV aid recipient dies, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original loan that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended. This is detailed in Appendix B of the FSA Handbook. Secondly, for clinical work included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the FSA Handbook allows for exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules. If clinical work begins before or ends after the normal term dates, the loan period start and end dates must be adjusted accordingly. This ensures that the academic year period and payment period dates align with the clinical work schedule, as explained in Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook.",1.0,1.0,0.81,0.9370081231458863,0.3999999996,0.09090909090909091,6.272791862487793,contextual_compression_rag
"What happens to a student's Direct Unsubsidized Loan eligibility if their parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan, and how does entrance counseling play a role in this process?","['Chapter 2\nDirect Loan Counseling\nCounseling Overview\nFirst-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a\nDirect Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled\non at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default. Your school can also offer financial literacy classes, on a credit or non-credit basis, that include\ninformation on budgeting, debt management, anticipated earnings by profession, elements of loan counseling, etc.,\nthough eligibility for a Direct Loan cannot be contingent on completion of such a class.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrowers\nBelow we provide a summary of the information that must be covered in entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan\nand Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers.

One such situation is when a dependent undergraduate qualifies for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, but in a subsequent academic year the student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan. In this circumstance the dependent student no longer qualifies for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. During any academic year when a dependent student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student is subject to the dependent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student otherwise would have been eligible to receive under the dependent undergraduate annual loan limits are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the $31,000 combined subsidized and unsubsidized dependent undergraduate aggregate limit (see Example 3 below). A similar situation occurs when a student who received loans for a graduate or professional degree program later returns to school and enrolls in an undergraduate program. The student is then subject to the undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student previously received as an undergraduate are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the undergraduate aggregate loan limit (see Example 2 earlier in this chapter). Volume 8, Chapter 4, Example 3: Aggregate Loan Limits and Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Amounts When Parents Are Unable To Obtain Direct PLUS Loans A dependent student receives additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the additional amounts available to independent undergraduates) for the first three years of a four-year program because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan for each of those years. For each of the first three years, the student receives the maximum subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts under the independent student annual loan limits (remember that the annual subsidized maximums are the same for dependent and independent undergraduates): First Year (independent student loan limit) $3,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Second Year (independent student loan limit) $4,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Third Year (independent student loan limit) $5,500 subsidized $7,000 unsubsidized ($5,000 more than dependent maximum) Total $13,500 subsidized $19,000 unsubsidized ($13,000 more than dependent maximum) In the fourth year, the parent is eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, so the student is then subject to the annual and aggregate loan limits for a dependent undergraduate. The dependent student received a total of $13,500 in Direct Subsidized Loan funds and $19,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds ($32,500 combined subsidized and unsubsidized total) for the first three years when the student9s parent was unable to obtain Direct PLUS Loans.

In the case of a graduate or professional student who requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan.

Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan to a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling. Entrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are about to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person counseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. If entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable steps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the terms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the borrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic document. Your school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance education, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed. You may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance counseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements are reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that unreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling can include one or more of the following: Extra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods; A requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though you cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan); A requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or A requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.']","The context provided does not explicitly state what happens to a student's Direct Unsubsidized Loan eligibility if their parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the impact on the student's loan eligibility in this specific scenario.

However, it is clear that entrance counseling is a requirement for all first-time student borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and student Direct PLUS Loans. This counseling is designed to inform borrowers about the terms and conditions of their loans, their repayment responsibilities, and the consequences of default. It must be completed before the first disbursement of the loan can occur.

If you need more specific information about the relationship between Direct PLUS Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans, or how eligibility might change, that information is not included in the provided context.","If a dependent student's parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student no longer qualifies for the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. Instead, the student is subject to the dependent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits.

Because Direct PLUS Loans can be made for up to the full COA minus other financial\nassistance received, the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount may not be sufficient to substitute entirely for the\namount a parent could receive under the Direct PLUS Loan program. Therefore, you should determine whether the\nparents may be able to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser who does not have an adverse credit history\nbefore originating additional unsubsidized loan amounts for the dependent student. Before a dependent student can\nreceive the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount, you must document the basis of the student9s eligibility. Some\nbasic guidelines for making this determination are discussed below. However, keep in mind that none of the following, by\nthemselves, are sufficient to make a dependent student eligible for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds:\nThe parent9s unwillingness to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan (even though the parent would otherwise be eligible to\nborrow);\nThe school9s decision not to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan program; or\nThe financial aid administrator9s belief that the parent should not borrow a Direct PLUS Loan.\nGeneral Guidelines for Determining That a Dependent Student May Receive Additional Unsubsidized Funds\nThe sections that follow provide general guidelines for making a determination that a dependent student is eligible to\nreceive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds under various circumstances.\nOnly One Parent Has Applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and Been Denied\nIf only one of a student9s parents has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and been denied based on adverse credit, you may\naward additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds on that basis, without first determining whether there is another parent\nwho could take out a Direct PLUS Loan. However, if both parents apply independently and one is approved and the other\ndenied, the dependent student is not eligible for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts.\nA Previously Approved Parent Later Requests Additional Direct PLUS Loan Funds and Is Denied\nThe dependent student may become eligible at any time during an academic year if a parent has first been approved and\nthen later denied a Direct PLUS Loan. For example, if a parent was approved for and received the full amount of a Direct\nPLUS Loan for a fall-spring loan period, but the parent is subsequently determined ineligible due to having an adverse\ncredit history when they request additional Direct PLUS Loan funds later during the spring semester, you may award\nIncreased Direct Unsubsidized Loan Eligibility for Independent Undergraduates and Certain\nDependent Undergraduates\n34 CFR 685.203(c)', 'information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form\nIf you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information\nsections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the\nstudent, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up\nto the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent\nsecond-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume\nfor information on annual loan limits).

A parent\nwho had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements\noutlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal\ngovernment holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated.

This chapter discusses other eligibility requirements that are\nspecific to the Direct Loan Program.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\nOnly students who have financial need may receive Direct Subsidized Loans. The federal government does not charge\ninterest on Direct Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled on at least a half-time basis, during the grace and\ndeferment periods, and during certain other periods (for example, during certain periods of repayment under certain\nrepayment plans that determine the required monthly payment amount based on the borrower9s income and family size).\nIf a student has received a determination of need for a Direct Subsidized Loan in an amount of $200 or less, a school may\nchoose not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and may instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan.\nFinancial need is not an eligibility requirement to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. The federal government generally\ncharges interest on Direct Unsubsidized Loans during all periods, with limited exceptions (for example, during periods of\ndeferment for cancer treatment).\nTo be eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, an undergraduate student attending a\nschool that participates in the Federal Pell Grant Program must first have received a determination of their Pell Grant\neligibility for the period of enrollment for which the student is requesting a loan.\nNo Minimum Age To Receive a Direct Loan\nStudents who are minors may receive Direct Loans, but they may not refuse to repay the loans based on a <defense of\ninfancy= (that is, by claiming that they were too young to enter into the contract of signing the promissory note).\nRequirement To Offer Both Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans\nDirect Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are two components of a single loan program.

For these students, the combined Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual\nloan limits are shown below in Table 1B.\nAs with the loan limits for dependent undergraduates, the <Total (Subsidized and Unsubsidized)= limits represent the total\nof all Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans that an independent undergraduate student (or a dependent\nundergraduate whose parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan) may borrow at each level of study, for a single\nacademic year. For example, an independent, first-year undergraduate may receive up to $9,500 in Direct Subsidized\nLoans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans for a single academic year, but no more than $3,500 of this amount may be\nsubsidized. An independent first-year undergraduate who has no subsidized loan eligibility may receive up to the full\n$9,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds.\nAlthough a dependent undergraduate whose parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan has access to the same higher\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan annual loan limits as an independent undergraduate at the same grade level, the student is still\nconsidered to be a dependent student for all other Title IV purposes.\nFor more detail on the conditions under which a dependent undergraduate can receive increased Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan amounts, see <Criteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Funds= below.\nVolume 8, Chapter 4, Table 1B: Independent Undergraduate Annual Limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct\nUnsubsidized Loans\nIndependent Undergraduates (and Dependent Undergraduates\nWhose Parents Can9t Get Direct PLUS Loans)\nTotal (Subsidized and\nUnsubsidized)\nMaximum\nSubsidized', 'dependent student annual loan limits, the total loan amounts received would have been $13,500 in Direct\nSubsidized Loan funds and $6,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds ($19,500 combined subsidized and\nunsubsidized total).\nBecause the combined subsidized and unsubsidized loan amount of $32,500 that the student received for years\none through three exceeds the $31,000 dependent undergraduate aggregate loan limit, it might appear that the\nstudent would have no remaining loan eligibility for the fourth year of the program. However, only the $19,500 in\ncombined subsidized and unsubsidized loan funds that the student could have received under the dependent\nstudent annual loan limits are counted against the $31,000 aggregate, leaving the student with $11,500 in\nremaining loan eligibility under the dependent undergraduate aggregate loan limit, not more than $9,500 of\nwhich may be subsidized. Therefore, in the fourth year of the program (when the student9s parent is eligible to\nreceive a Direct PLUS Loan), the student could receive up to the full combined subsidized and unsubsidized\nannual loan limit for a dependent fourth-year undergraduate (that is, $7,500, not more than $5,500 of which may\nbe subsidized).', 'counted toward the borrower9s aggregate Direct Loan limits.\nEffect of a Change in Student Status on Aggregate Loan Limits\nIn some cases, a student may qualify for higher loan limits but then lose eligibility for the higher limits due to a change in\nstatus. One such situation is when a dependent undergraduate qualifies for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts\nbecause the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, but in a subsequent academic year the student9s\nparent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan. In this circumstance the dependent student no longer qualifies for the additional\nunsubsidized loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. During any\nacademic year when a dependent student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student is subject to the\ndependent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student otherwise would have\nbeen eligible to receive under the dependent undergraduate annual loan limits are counted when determining the\nstudent9s remaining eligibility under the $31,000 combined subsidized and unsubsidized dependent undergraduate\naggregate limit (see Example 3 below).\nA similar situation occurs when a student who received loans for a graduate or professional degree program later returns\nto school and enrolls in an undergraduate program. The student is then subject to the undergraduate annual and\naggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student previously received as an undergraduate are counted when\ndetermining the student9s remaining eligibility under the undergraduate aggregate loan limit (see Example 2 earlier in this\nchapter).\nVolume 8, Chapter 4, Example 3: Aggregate Loan Limits and Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Amounts When\nParents Are Unable To Obtain Direct PLUS Loans\nA dependent student receives additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the additional amounts available\nto independent undergraduates) for the first three years of a four-year program because the student9s parent is\nunable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan for each of those years.\nFor each of the first three years, the student receives the maximum subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts\nunder the independent student annual loan limits (remember that the annual subsidized maximums are the same\nfor dependent and independent undergraduates):\nFirst Year (independent student loan\nlimit)\n$3,500\nsubsidized\n$6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent\nmaximum)\nSecond Year (independent student\nloan limit)\n$4,500\nsubsidized\n$6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent\nmaximum)\nThird Year (independent student loan\nlimit)\n$5,500\nsubsidized\n$7,000 unsubsidized ($5,000 more than dependent\nmaximum)\nTotal\n$13,500\nsubsidized\n$19,000 unsubsidized ($13,000 more than dependent\nmaximum)\nIn the fourth year, the parent is eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, so the student is then subject to the annual\nand aggregate loan limits for a dependent undergraduate.

For instance, under these circumstances a dependent second-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume for information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of the other Title IV programs.

A parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who meets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a student. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent who had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements outlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3.

In such cases, the student may be eligible for an amount up to the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For example, a second-year dependent undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds.

For example, if a student9s biological or legal adoptive parents are divorced, they may decide to each take out a\nDirect PLUS Loan for an agreed upon amount (not to exceed the student9s COA, minus other financial assistance (OFA)) to\nhelp pay for the cost of the student9s education.\nRequirement for Dependent Students To File a FAFSA Form\nIn all cases, the dependent student on whose behalf a parent has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan must have filed a FAFSA\nform and received an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or FAFSA Submission Summary (see Chapter 1 of the\nApplication and Verification Guide for information on the ISIR and FAFSA Submission Summary). This requirement ensures\nthat student eligibility data matches are conducted to verify that the dependent student on whose behalf the parent is\nborrowing:\nIs not in default on a Title IV loan and does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant;\nHas had their Social Security number verified by the Social Security Administration; and\nHas had their citizenship status confirmed by either the Social Security Administration or the Department of\nHomeland Security.\nNote that this requirement is for the student to submit a FAFSA form. It is not a requirement for the parent borrower to\nsubmit a FAFSA form in the parent9s name, and it does not preclude an otherwise eligible parent whose information is not\nincluded on the FAFSA form (sometimes referred to as a <non-custodial= parent) from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan.\nBefore originating a Direct PLUS Loan for a parent borrower, schools must review the ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary\nof the dependent student to ensure there are no student eligibility issues that must be resolved before the parent can\nreceive the Direct PLUS Loan.\nAdverse Credit History\nAn individual with an adverse credit history is prohibited from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan unless they meet additional\neligibility requirements. The Department obtains a credit report on each student or parent applicant for a Direct PLUS\nLoan. An applicant is considered to have an adverse credit history if:\nThey have one or more debts with a total combined outstanding balance greater than $2,085 that (1) are 90 or more\ndays delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or (2) have been placed in collection or charged-off during the two\nyears preceding the date of the credit report; or\nDuring the five years preceding the date of the credit report, the applicant has been determined to be in default on a\ndebt; has had debts discharged in bankruptcy; or has been the subject of foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage\ngarnishment, or write-off of a Title IV debt.\nFor Direct PLUS Loan eligibility purposes, <charged-off= means a debt that has been written off as a loss, but that is still\nsubject to collection action. <In collection= means a debt that has been placed with a collection agency by a creditor or\nthat is subject to more intensive efforts by a creditor to recover amounts owed from a borrower who has not responded\nsatisfactorily to the routine demands of the creditor9s billing procedures.\nAn applicant cannot be denied a Direct PLUS Loan because they have no credit history. That is, the absence of a credit\nhistory is not considered to be adverse credit.\nThere are two means by which a Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit history can still qualify for a Direct\nPLUS Loan. One option is for the applicant to obtain an endorser who doesn9t have an adverse credit history. An endorser\nis someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower doesn9t repay it. For a parent borrower, the\nendorser may not be the dependent student for whom the parent is borrowing.\nAs an alternative to obtaining an endorser, an applicant who has been determined to have an adverse credit history may\nalso qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan by submitting documentation to the Department showing that there are extenuating\ncircumstances associated with the adverse credit. The Department has the final decision on determining whether\nextenuating circumstances exist.\nA borrower who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting to the satisfaction of the\nDepartment that extenuating circumstances exist must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling, as discussed below.', 'First Year\n$9,500\n$3,500\nSecond Year\n$10,500\n$4,500\nThird Year and Beyond\n$12,500\n$5,500\nCriteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Funds\nDependent students whose parents are unable to borrow Direct PLUS Loans due to adverse credit or other exceptional\ncircumstances may receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds up to the same amount that is available to\nindependent undergraduate students. Because Direct PLUS Loans can be made for up to the full COA minus other financial\nassistance received, the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount may not be sufficient to substitute entirely for the\namount a parent could receive under the Direct PLUS Loan program. Therefore, you should determine whether the\nparents may be able to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser who does not have an adverse credit history\nbefore originating additional unsubsidized loan amounts for the dependent student. Before a dependent student can\nreceive the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount, you must document the basis of the student9s eligibility. Some\nbasic guidelines for making this determination are discussed below. However, keep in mind that none of the following, by\nthemselves, are sufficient to make a dependent student eligible for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds:\nThe parent9s unwillingness to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan (even though the parent would otherwise be eligible to\nborrow);\nThe school9s decision not to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan program; or\nThe financial aid administrator9s belief that the parent should not borrow a Direct PLUS Loan.\nGeneral Guidelines for Determining That a Dependent Student May Receive Additional Unsubsidized Funds\nThe sections that follow provide general guidelines for making a determination that a dependent student is eligible to\nreceive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds under various circumstances.\nOnly One Parent Has Applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and Been Denied\nIf only one of a student9s parents has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and been denied based on adverse credit, you may\naward additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds on that basis, without first determining whether there is another parent\nwho could take out a Direct PLUS Loan. However, if both parents apply independently and one is approved and the other\ndenied, the dependent student is not eligible for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts.\nA Previously Approved Parent Later Requests Additional Direct PLUS Loan Funds and Is Denied\nThe dependent student may become eligible at any time during an academic year if a parent has first been approved and\nthen later denied a Direct PLUS Loan. For example, if a parent was approved for and received the full amount of a Direct\nPLUS Loan for a fall-spring loan period, but the parent is subsequently determined ineligible due to having an adverse\ncredit history when they request additional Direct PLUS Loan funds later during the spring semester, you may award\nIncreased Direct Unsubsidized Loan Eligibility for Independent Undergraduates and Certain\nDependent Undergraduates\n34 CFR 685.203(c)', 'additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the student. However, the Direct PLUS Loan funds that the parent previously\nreceived during the same period of enrollment must be treated as OFA when determining the additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan amount that the student is eligible to receive.\nA Parent Is Unable To Borrow a Direct PLUS Loan For Reasons Other Than Adverse Credit History (Exceptional\nCircumstances)\nIn addition to cases in which a parent has been denied a Direct PLUS Loan due to adverse credit, a dependent\nundergraduate student may also be eligible for increased unsubsidized loan amounts if you determine and document the\nexistence of exceptional circumstances other than adverse credit that would prevent a parent from borrowing a Direct\nPLUS Loan.\nIf you make such a determination, you may award increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts to a dependent\nundergraduate even if the student9s parent previously applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and was found to not have an\nadverse credit history. Similarly, if you make such a determination before a parent has requested a Direct PLUS Loan, you\nmay award the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student without requiring the parent to apply\nfor a Direct PLUS Loan.\nExamples of such exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited, to the following:\nThe parent is incarcerated.\nThe parent9s whereabouts are unknown.\nThe parent has filed for bankruptcy and has provided a letter from the bankruptcy court stating that as a condition of\nthe bankruptcy filing, the parent may not incur any additional debt.\nThe parent9s income is limited to public assistance or disability benefits, and you have documented that the parent\nwould not be able to repay the Direct PLUS Loan.\nYou have examined the family financial information and documented the parent9s likely inability to repay the Direct\nPLUS Loan due to an existing debt burden or the parent9s expected income-to-debt ratio.\nThe parent of a dependent student is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, is not a qualified alien, or is not able\nto provide evidence from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that they are in the United States for other\nthan a temporary purpose with the intention of becoming a citizen or permanent resident.\nBefore originating a loan for the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts based on a parent9s ineligibility for a Direct\nPLUS Loan due to adverse credit or other exceptional circumstances, you must document the basis of the dependent\nstudent9s eligibility.\nA determination that a parent is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan in one academic year based on adverse credit or other\nexceptional circumstances does not automatically support the dependent student9s additional unsubsidized loan eligibility\nin subsequent years. If a dependent student is determined to be eligible for additional unsubsidized loan amounts in one\nacademic year, you must re-examine and document that the basis for the student9s eligibility continues to exist before\noriginating additional unsubsidized loan amounts for the student in a subsequent year.\nAnnual Loan Limit for Graduate and Professional Students\nThe annual loan limit for graduate or professional students is shown below in Table 1C. Graduate and professional\nstudents are not eligible to receive Direct Subsidized Loans, so the annual loan limit for these students represents only\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans.\nA student in an undergraduate program is not eligible for the graduate loan limit based on taking graduate coursework as\na part of the undergraduate program. In contrast, a graduate student taking some undergraduate coursework is eligible\nfor the graduate loan limit if the student is enrolled at least half time in courses (graduate or undergraduate) that can be\napplied to the graduate program. However, the student must already be admitted into the graduate program.\nA student with a bachelor9s degree who is taking preparatory work for graduate school (or whose full admission to the\ngraduate program is contingent upon completion of certain undergraduate courses) is not eligible for graduate loan limits.\nSee the discussion later in this chapter on annual loan limits for students taking preparatory coursework.', 'If your school participates in the Direct PLUS program but a student9s parent cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the\nstudent is allowed to borrow additional unsubsidized funds (see <Criteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan Funds= in Chapter 4 of this volume).\nRequired Counseling for Direct PLUS Loan Applicants With Adverse Credit\nAny student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has an adverse credit history but qualifies by obtaining an endorser\nor documenting that there are extenuating circumstances must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling on the\nDepartment9s StudentAid.gov website.\nAdverse Credit History and Default\nAlthough a default on a Title IV loan will generally appear in a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant9s credit record\nand result in the individual being determined to have an adverse credit history, being in default on a Title IV loan and\nhaving an adverse credit history are separate eligibility issues. A Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified through the\nDepartment9s National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as being in default on a Title IV loan and who has also been\ndetermined to have an adverse credit history (due to the default and/or other adverse credit conditions) cannot qualify for\na Direct PLUS Loan simply by obtaining an endorser or by providing acceptable documentation of extenuating\ncircumstances. The applicant must also separately resolve the default status by one of the means discussed under\n<Resolving Default Status= in Volume 1, Chapter 3.\nIn some cases, the Direct PLUS Loan credit check may not reveal a default on a Title IV loan, particularly if the default is\nnot recent. If a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified in NSLDS as being in default on a Title IV\nloan does not have any other adverse credit issues, the applicant will pass the PLUS credit check. In this circumstance you\ncannot assume that the approved credit check result supersedes the information in NSLDS. The default must be resolved\nbefore you can disburse Direct PLUS Loan funds or other Title IV aid to the applicant.\nDirect PLUS Loan Application\nSchools that offer Direct PLUS Loans have the option of requiring student and parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants to\ncomplete the Direct PLUS Loan Application (formally known as the ""Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request for Supplemental\nInformation"") on the Department\'s StudentAid.gov website as the first step in applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. The Direct\nPLUS Loan Application collects the requested loan amount, the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended, and\nother information related to processing the requested Direct PLUS Loan.\nUse of the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov is not required. Schools may choose to develop their own\nprocesses for obtaining the information needed to originate Direct PLUS Loans.\nAlthough the Department9s FAFSA Processing System (FPS) matches student Direct PLUS Loan applicants against NSLDS\nto determine if they are in default on a Title IV loan, it does not perform this match for parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants.\nHowever, the Department conducts an NSLDS default check on all Direct PLUS Loan applicants (both students and\nparents) who complete the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov.\nSchools that use the Direct PLUS Loan Application are notified of the result of the NSLDS default check through the\nCommon Origination and Disbursement (COD) System. The result is reported as one of the following values:\n""N"" = The borrower is not in default on any Title IV loan.\nDefinition of <Adverse Credit History=\n34 CFR 685.200(c)(2)(viii)(B)\n34 CFR 685.200(b)(5)', 'completing their program of study so that the school can provide exit counseling;\nProvide information on how the borrower can access their records in the National Student Loan Data System\n(NSLDS); and\nProvide the name of the individual the borrower may contact if the borrower has questions about the borrower9s\nrights and responsibilities or the terms and conditions of the loan.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Graduate and Professional Student Direct PLUS Loan Borrowers\nThe information that must be covered in entrance counseling for graduate and professional student Direct PLUS Loan\nborrowers is summarized below.

Note also that more than one parent can take out a Direct PLUS Loan on behalf of the same dependent undergraduate']","Direct PLUS Loans are available to two specific groups: graduate and professional students, and the parents of dependent undergraduate students. 

1. **Graduate and Professional Students**: These students can apply for Direct PLUS Loans to help cover their educational costs. They are not eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans, so the Direct PLUS Loan represents their primary federal loan option.

2. **Parents of Dependent Undergraduate Students**: A parent can obtain a Direct PLUS Loan to pay for the education costs of their dependent undergraduate child, provided the child meets the eligibility criteria for federal student aid. The parent must also meet certain requirements, including citizenship and residency criteria, and must not be in default on a Title IV loan or owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant.

**Eligibility Requirements for Parents**:
- The parent must be the biological or legal adoptive parent of the student, or a stepparent if required to provide information on the FAFSA.
- Grandparents or other relatives cannot take out a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have legally adopted the student.
- The dependent student must have filed a FAFSA form.

**Ineligibility Conditions for Parents**:
- Parents with an adverse credit history may be denied a Direct PLUS Loan unless they obtain an endorser or can document extenuating circumstances.
- Parents who are incarcerated or have a judgment lien against their property are also ineligible.

In summary, both graduate/professional students and parents of dependent undergraduate students can obtain Direct PLUS Loans, subject to specific eligibility criteria and conditions.","The following individuals can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent undergraduate student: the student's biological parent, the student's legal adoptive parent, or the student's stepparent, but only if the stepparent is required to provide their information on the FAFSA form.

See <When A Student Fails to Begin Attendance= in Volume 4, Chapter 3.\nIf a student does not withdraw but ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a school may make a late\ndisbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred by the student for a period in which the student was eligible. However,\nthis does not apply if the student dropped all future classes or modules, because the student never began classes as a\nhalf-time student.\nTitle IV program funds (including Direct Loans) are disbursed to a student on the presumption that the student will attend\nthe hours for which aid has been awarded. Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of a Direct Loan\nuntil a student has begun attendance in enough hours to establish half-time enrollment status. However, if a school has\nnot yet made a Direct Loan disbursement to a student who has dropped classes, and the school determines that the\nstudent never began attendance in enough classes to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a\nfirst disbursement of a Direct Loan to that student.\nLikewise, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules drops all future classes before beginning attendance in\nenough modules to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan\nbecause the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis. If a student who dropped to less-than-half-time\nstatus resumes enrollment on a half-time basis during the payment period or period of enrollment, the school may make\nremaining disbursements of a Direct Loan if the school documents (1) the student9s revised COA, and (2) that the student\ncontinues to qualify for the entire amount of the loan, despite any reduction in the student9s COA caused by the\ntemporary cessation of enrollment on at least a half-time basis.\nDCL GEN-16-10\nLate Disbursements for Students Who Cease To Be Enrolled at Least Half Time\n34 CFR 668.164(j)(3)(iii)\nDirect Loan Disbursements to Students Who Temporarily Cease Half-Time Enrollment\n34 CFR 685.303(b)(3)(iv)', 'A dependent student is enrolled in a two-year credit-hour program offered in standard terms (quarters).

In addition, the schools must ensure that there is no duplication of non-\ninstitutional costs when determining the student9s COA. Note that in the situation where a student is concurrently enrolled\nand eligible at more than one school, which is different than the consortium arrangements discussed in Volume 2, Chapter\n2, loan funds awarded at one school are not to be included as OFA by any other school the student is attending when\ndetermining the student9s loan eligibility for the same period.\nExceptions to the <Regular Student= Requirement for Direct Loans\nAs explained in Volume 1, Chapter 1, one of the eligibility requirements for a student to receive Title IV aid is that the\nstudent must be enrolled at an eligible school for the purpose of obtaining a degree or certificate offered by the school.\nSuch a student is known as a <regular student.= However, there are two limited exceptions to this requirement for Direct\nLoans: preparatory coursework and teacher certification coursework.\nPreparatory Coursework\nA student may receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan (or a parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan\non behalf of a dependent student) for preparatory coursework that the school has documented is necessary for the\nstudent to enroll in an eligible program. The preparatory courses must be offered as part of an eligible program offered by\nthe school, though the student does not have to be enrolled in that program. A school may not award Direct Loans for\nstandalone courses that do not count towards an eligible program and exist solely to serve as preparatory coursework.\nA student who is enrolled at least half time in preparatory coursework as described above is eligible to receive loans for a\nmaximum of one consecutive 12-month period (not per program) beginning on the first day of the loan period. If the\nconsecutive 12-month period of preparatory coursework spans more than one academic year, the student may receive\nmore than one annual loan limit.\nTo be eligible for loans under this exception, the student must be taking classes that are a prerequisite for admission. A\nstudent who is only taking courses to raise their grade-point average in order to be admitted does not qualify.\nPreparatory Coursework at a Different School\nRegular Student\n34 CFR 600.2\nPreparatory Coursework\n34 CFR 668.32(a)(1)(ii)\n34 CFR 685.203(a)(6) and (c)(2)(vi)', ""If you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower has received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of their\nfinancial need, and the student is still enrolled for the loan period, you must return the subsidized loan amount for which\nthe student was ineligible and ask the student if they wish to replace the subsidized funds with a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan. If the student agrees to accept the unsubsidized loan funds and they also received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for\nthe same loan period as the Direct Subsidized Loan, you may increase the amount of the Direct Unsubsidized Loan\ndisbursements by the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. If the student did\nnot receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you may originate a new Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the amount of the Direct\nSubsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. The new Direct Unsubsidized Loan must have the same loan\nperiod and disbursement dates as the Direct Subsidized Loan.\nIf the student does not agree to have the excess subsidized loan funds replaced by a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must\nstill return the ineligible Direct Subsidized Loan amount.\nIf you discover that a student received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of financial need after the student is no\nlonger enrolled for the loan period, you are not required to take any action to eliminate the excess subsidized loan\namount.\nIf you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower who was eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan instead received a\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan, you must correct the error (even if the loan period has ended) by submitting a downward\nadjustment to reduce or eliminate the Direct Unsubsidized Loan, as appropriate, and replacing it with the same amount of\nDirect Subsidized Loan funds. You may do this either by adjusting an existing Direct Subsidized Loan upwards, or, if the\nstudent does not have an existing Direct Subsidized Loan, by originating a new Direct Subsidized Loan. Replacing a Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan with a Direct Subsidized Loan in this circumstance does not require obtaining the student9s consent.\nDirect Loan Overawards\nAs explained in Volume 4, Chapter 3, an overaward exists when a student9s aid package exceeds their need or overall\nCOA. If you discover that a student who received Direct Loans has been overawarded and your school has already\nreceived and disbursed some or all of the Direct Loan funds, you have the following options:\nIf the student9s aid package includes a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, or a nonfederal education loan,\nand the aid package doesn9t already apply these loans toward the student9s SAI, you may choose to adjust the aid\npackage to have all or a portion of these loans replace the SAI, thus reducing or eliminating the overaward (for more\ndetail and examples, see <Substituting for the SAI= in Volume 3, Chapter 3).\nIf you have not yet made the second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan, you can reduce or cancel the\nsecond or subsequent disbursement.\nIf the overaward situation occurs after the full amount of a Direct Loan has been disbursed, you do not need to adjust the\namount of the loan. However, you might have to adjust the aid package to prevent an overaward of Campus-Based funds\nor to prevent the total aid package from exceeding the student9s need.\nAlthough a school isn9t required to return Direct Loan funds that were disbursed to the borrower (either directly or by\napplying them to the student's account) before the overaward situation occurred, the law doesn9t prevent your school\nfrom returning funds that were applied to the student account if you choose to do so. A borrower who receives a direct\npayment of loan funds is not required to repay an overawarded amount, unless the overaward was caused by the\nborrower9s misreporting or withholding of information.\nLoan Periods\nThe loan period (also referred to as the <period of enrollment=) is the period for which a Direct Loan is intended. It must\ncoincide with an academic period established by the school for which institutional charges are generally assessed (e.g.,\nsemester, trimester, quarter, length of the student9s program, or academic year). It9s important to define the loan period\nat the beginning of the loan awarding process, because the timing and amount of Direct Loan disbursements are tied to\nthe loan period.\nGenerally, the loan period may not include terms in which a student is ineligible (for example, if the student is not enrolled\nduring a particular term or is enrolled less than half time during a term). There is a limited exception to this rule if the loan\nperiod begins and ends with a term in which the student is eligible for Direct Loans, but the first and last terms of the loan"", 'amount.\nDirect Loan Disbursements When the Loan Period is a Single Payment Period\nAs explained in Volume 3, Chapter 1, all Title IV program funds (including Direct Loan funds) except for Federal Work-\nStudy payments must be disbursed on a payment period basis. Except in certain cases for Direct Loans made to cover the\ncosts of a study abroad program (see below), if the loan period for a Direct Loan covers more than one payment period, a\nschool must make at least one Direct Loan disbursement in each payment period.\nIf the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, a school must generally make at least two disbursements\nof a Direct Loan (see below for two exceptions to this requirement). The following requirements apply for the timing of the\nsecond disbursement:\nFor credit-hour programs offered in standard terms or offered in nonstandard terms that are substantially equal in\nlength with no term less than nine weeks of instructional time in length, the second disbursement may not be made\nuntil the calendar midpoint between the first and last scheduled days of class in the loan period.\nFor all other programs, including clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, and nonstandard term programs\nwith terms that are not substantially equal or with terms that are substantially equal and less than nine weeks of\ninstructional time in length, the second disbursement may not be made until the student successfully completes half\nof the weeks of instructional time in the payment period, and half of the clock or credit hours in the payment period.\nExceptions to the Multiple Disbursement Requirement When the Loan Period is a Single Payment Period\nIf the loan period is not more than one semester, one trimester, one quarter or, for non-term-based schools or schools\nwith nonstandard terms, four months, a school with a cohort default rate of less than 15% for each of the three most\nrecent fiscal years for which data are available may disburse a Direct Loan in a single installment.\nIn addition, if the loan period is a single payment period and more than half of the payment period has elapsed before the\nschool has made a disbursement, the school may include in the disbursement loan proceeds for the entire payment\nperiod.\nException to the Multiple Disbursement Requirement for Study Abroad Programs\nSubstantially Equal Disbursements\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(5)\nRegulatory Citations\nLoan period is more than one payment period: 34 CFR 685.303(d)(3)(i)\nLoan period is one payment period: 34 CFR 685.303(d)(3)(ii)\nException based on cohort default rate: 34 CFR 685.303(d)(6)(i)(A)\nMore than half of payment period has elapsed: 34 CFR 685.303(d)(4)(ii)', 'period are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be\nenrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and\nspring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be\nenrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering\nthe fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s\nCOA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a\nschool initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of\nat least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily\ndrops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not\nrequired to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school\nto adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and\nspring quarters only.\nIn the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-\nonly loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring\nloan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would\nthen be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining\nthe student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods\nOther Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a\nstudent9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs\nassociated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the\nfall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine\nmonths.\nThe limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last\nterms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period.\nFor instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall\nterm or the spring term.\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when\nperiods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\nMinimum Loan Periods\nThe minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar.\nAs explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a\nDirect Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on\nwhether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard\nor nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the\ncase of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below.\nNonstandard terms may be one of the following types:\n1. \nNonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any\nother term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length.\nSE9W\nPeriod of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition\n34 CFR 685.102(b)', 'hour, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is offered in modules, the minimum loan period is still the lesser of the\nacademic year or the program length (or remaining portion of the program).\nFor Title IV aid purposes, students are allowed to skip one or more modules. However, if a loan period includes modules\nthat the student does not attend, the COA for the loan period may not include costs associated with those modules.\nMinimum Loan Period: Standard Term Combined With an Intersession\nAs we explain under <Intersessions= in Volume 3, Chapter 1, in limited cases for academic programs offered in standard\nterms, a short nonstandard term (often called an <intersession=) may be combined with a preceding or following standard\nterm and considered to be a single standard term. In such cases, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is different\ndepending on whether a student attends the intersession. If a student who attends the intersession requests a loan for the\ncombined term, the loan period includes the standard term plus the intersession. However, if the student attends only the\nstandard term and is not enrolled in the intersession that is attached to that term, the loan period includes only the\nstandard term.\nMaximum Loan Periods\nThe maximum period for which you may originate a Direct Loan is generally an academic year. However, if your school\napplies the annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans to a period of time greater than\nan academic year, you may originate a Direct Loan for that longer period of time. For example, a school might offer an\n1100 clock-hour program and define the academic year as 900 clock hours but could choose to allow students to receive\njust one annual loan limit for the entire 1100-hour program. In that case, the loan period would correspond to the length\nof the program, a period of time that is longer than the academic year.\nDirect Loan Disbursement Requirements\nFor general guidance on the timing of disbursements made under the Title IV programs, see Volume 3, Chapter 1. For\nguidance on reporting Title IV program disbursements through the COD System and the rules for making early\ndisbursements, late disbursements, and retroactive payments, see Volume 4, Chapter 2. In this section we discuss certain\nother disbursement requirements that are specific to the Direct Loan Program.\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal Direct Loan disbursement\nrequirements that apply when periods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\nRequirement for Substantially Equal Disbursements\nDirect Loans must be disbursed in substantially equal installments, regardless of any difference in costs for different\npayment periods that are within the same loan period, and no Direct Loan disbursement may exceed one-half of the loan\nMaximum Loan Period\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(10)(iv)\nDetermining Direct Loan Disbursement Dates and Amounts\n34 CFR 685.303(d)']","['Direct Loan Eligibility After an Enrollment Status Change If a student who received a disbursement of Direct Loan funds prior to the first day of classes of a payment period begins attendance on a less-than-half-time basis, there is no requirement for the school or the student to return the loan funds as long as: The student began attendance in at least one course during the payment period; and At the time of the loan disbursement the student was enrolled (registered) for classes on at least a half-time basis. However, the school must not make any subsequent disbursements of the loan unless the student resumes enrollment on at least a half-time basis during the payment period. A student who is no longer enrolled at least half time may not receive as a late disbursement any second or subsequent disbursement of the loan. Note that different requirements apply if a student who received a Direct Loan disbursement prior to the first day of classes fails to begin attendance in any classes. See <When A Student Fails to Begin Attendance= in Volume 4, Chapter 3. If a student does not withdraw but ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a school may make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred by the student for a period in which the student was eligible. However, this does not apply if the student dropped all future classes or modules, because the student never began classes as a half-time student. Title IV program funds (including Direct Loans) are disbursed to a student on the presumption that the student will attend the hours for which aid has been awarded. Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of a Direct Loan until a student has begun attendance in enough hours to establish half-time enrollment status. However, if a school has not yet made a Direct Loan disbursement to a student who has dropped classes, and the school determines that the student never began attendance in enough classes to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan to that student. Likewise, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules drops all future classes before beginning attendance in enough modules to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan because the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis. If a student who dropped to less-than-half-time status resumes enrollment on a half-time basis during the payment period or period of enrollment, the school may make remaining disbursements of a Direct Loan if the school documents (1) the student9s revised COA, and (2) that the student continues to qualify for the entire amount of the loan, despite any reduction in the student9s COA caused by the temporary cessation of enrollment on at least a half-time basis. DCL GEN-16-10 Late Disbursements for Students Who Cease To Be Enrolled at Least Half Time 34 CFR 668.164(j)(3)(iii)']","If a student who has received a disbursement of Direct Loan funds begins attendance on a less-than-half-time basis, there is no requirement for the school or the student to return the loan funds, provided that:

1. The student began attendance in at least one course during the payment period.
2. At the time of the loan disbursement, the student was enrolled (registered) for classes on at least a half-time basis.

However, the school is not allowed to make any subsequent disbursements of the loan unless the student resumes enrollment on at least a half-time basis during the payment period. If the student is no longer enrolled at least half-time, they cannot receive any late disbursement for a second or subsequent disbursement of the loan.

"What are the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers, including those with adverse credit history, and what responsibilities do schools have in this process?","['Regardless of the counseling methods your school uses, it must document that the student received entrance and exit\ncounseling, and it must ensure that an individual with expertise in the Title IV programs is reasonably available shortly\nafter the counseling to answer the student9s questions.\nCounseling for Correspondence and Study Abroad Students\nIf a first-time student borrower has enrolled in a study-abroad program (approved by a U.S. school for credit) or a\ncorrespondence or distance learning program, the school must document that the student has completed online entrance\ncounseling that meets the regulatory Direct Loan entrance counseling requirements or provide written entrance\ncounseling information by mail or email before making the first disbursement of a Direct Loan to the student.\nIn the case of exit counseling for correspondence programs or study abroad programs, the school may mail or email the\nborrower written counseling materials within 30 days after the borrower completes the program, with a request that they\nprovide the contact and personal information that would ordinarily have been collected through the counseling process.\nProviding Additional Information\nYour school can take additional steps to counsel students, such as assisting them with developing a budget, estimating\nneed for loans, and planning for repayment. You can also reinforce messages to borrowers. For example, with each\ndisbursement you can remind students about the importance of maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP; see\nVolume 1, Chapter 1 for details on SAP requirements), planning for future employment, and staying in touch with the loan\nservicer. Sample measures for loan counseling are given in the <Sample Default Prevention Plan= that can be found in the\nregulations cited below.\nPLUS Loan Credit Counseling\nSpecial loan counseling is required for any student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has been determined to\nhave an adverse credit history, but who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan either by getting a loan endorser or by\ndocumenting to the satisfaction of the Department that there are extenuating circumstances related to the adverse\ncredit. While the special PLUS Loan Credit Counseling is mandatory only for these borrowers, any PLUS borrower can\nvoluntarily complete this counseling. See Chapter 1 of this volume for more information about adverse credit.\nNote that the special counseling described above is separate from the entrance counseling that all first-time graduate and\nprofessional student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers must complete, as described earlier in this chapter.\nAnnual Student Loan Acknowledgement\nThe Department offers a tool on the StudentAid.gov website called the Annual Student Loan Acknowledgement. The\nAlternative Approach for Entrance Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(a)(8)\nSample Default Prevention Plan\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-VI/part-668/subpart-N/appendix-Appendix A to Subpart N\nof Part 668"">34 CFR 668 Subpart N, Appendix A', 'Chapter 2\nDirect Loan Counseling\nCounseling Overview\nFirst-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a\nDirect Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled\non at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default. Your school can also offer financial literacy classes, on a credit or non-credit basis, that include\ninformation on budgeting, debt management, anticipated earnings by profession, elements of loan counseling, etc.,\nthough eligibility for a Direct Loan cannot be contingent on completion of such a class.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrowers\nBelow we provide a summary of the information that must be covered in entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan\nand Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers. For more detailed information, refer to the regulations cited at the end of this\nsection.\nEntrance counseling for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loan borrowers must:\nExplain the use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN);\nEmphasize the importance of the loan repayment obligation;\nDescribe the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, delinquent debt collection procedures\nunder Federal law, and litigation;\nEmphasize that the borrower must repay the full amount of the loan even if the borrower does not complete the\nprogram, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain\nemployment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services\nthat the student paid for with the loan;\nInform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on a range of student levels of\nindebtedness depending on the types of loans the borrower has received, or based on the average indebtedness of\nother borrowers in the same program at the same school;\nExplain how accepting the loan will affect the borrower9s eligibility for other forms of student financial assistance;\nProvide information on how interest accrues and is capitalized during periods when the interest is not paid by either\nthe borrower or the Department;\nInform the borrower of the option to pay the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan while the borrower is in school;\nExplain the definition of half-time enrollment at the school and the consequences of not maintaining half-time\nenrollment;\nExplain the importance of contacting the appropriate offices at the school if the borrower withdraws before\nDirect Loan Entrance Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(a)\nLoan Counseling Requirements and Flexibilities\nDCL GEN-15-06', 'If your school participates in the Direct PLUS program but a student9s parent cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the\nstudent is allowed to borrow additional unsubsidized funds (see <Criteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan Funds= in Chapter 4 of this volume).\nRequired Counseling for Direct PLUS Loan Applicants With Adverse Credit\nAny student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has an adverse credit history but qualifies by obtaining an endorser\nor documenting that there are extenuating circumstances must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling on the\nDepartment9s StudentAid.gov website.\nAdverse Credit History and Default\nAlthough a default on a Title IV loan will generally appear in a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant9s credit record\nand result in the individual being determined to have an adverse credit history, being in default on a Title IV loan and\nhaving an adverse credit history are separate eligibility issues. A Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified through the\nDepartment9s National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as being in default on a Title IV loan and who has also been\ndetermined to have an adverse credit history (due to the default and/or other adverse credit conditions) cannot qualify for\na Direct PLUS Loan simply by obtaining an endorser or by providing acceptable documentation of extenuating\ncircumstances. The applicant must also separately resolve the default status by one of the means discussed under\n<Resolving Default Status= in Volume 1, Chapter 3.\nIn some cases, the Direct PLUS Loan credit check may not reveal a default on a Title IV loan, particularly if the default is\nnot recent. If a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified in NSLDS as being in default on a Title IV\nloan does not have any other adverse credit issues, the applicant will pass the PLUS credit check. In this circumstance you\ncannot assume that the approved credit check result supersedes the information in NSLDS. The default must be resolved\nbefore you can disburse Direct PLUS Loan funds or other Title IV aid to the applicant.\nDirect PLUS Loan Application\nSchools that offer Direct PLUS Loans have the option of requiring student and parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants to\ncomplete the Direct PLUS Loan Application (formally known as the ""Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request for Supplemental\nInformation"") on the Department\'s StudentAid.gov website as the first step in applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. The Direct\nPLUS Loan Application collects the requested loan amount, the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended, and\nother information related to processing the requested Direct PLUS Loan.\nUse of the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov is not required. Schools may choose to develop their own\nprocesses for obtaining the information needed to originate Direct PLUS Loans.\nAlthough the Department9s FAFSA Processing System (FPS) matches student Direct PLUS Loan applicants against NSLDS\nto determine if they are in default on a Title IV loan, it does not perform this match for parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants.\nHowever, the Department conducts an NSLDS default check on all Direct PLUS Loan applicants (both students and\nparents) who complete the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov.\nSchools that use the Direct PLUS Loan Application are notified of the result of the NSLDS default check through the\nCommon Origination and Disbursement (COD) System. The result is reported as one of the following values:\n""N"" = The borrower is not in default on any Title IV loan.\nDefinition of <Adverse Credit History=\n34 CFR 685.200(c)(2)(viii)(B)\n34 CFR 685.200(b)(5)', ""provided by those companies are already offered free of charge through the Department or the borrower's loan\nservicer;\nProvide a general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers (i.e. student loan\ninterest deduction); and\nRequire the borrower to provide current information concerning their name, address, Social Security number,\nreferences, and driver9s license number and state of issuance, as well as the borrower9s expected permanent\naddress, the address of their next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower9s expected employer, if known\n(see also <Providing Borrower Information at Separation= below).\nAs stated above, Direct Loan exit counseling must provide borrowers with the information the Department makes\navailable in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA. This section of the law requires the Department to make available\nto postsecondary schools and other entities a wide variety of information about federal student assistance programs,\nincluding information to help students assess the debt burden and repayment obligations that will be incurred as a result\nof receiving Title IV loans. As noted below under <Counseling Methods,= documentation that a borrower has completed the\nDepartment9s online exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan exit counseling requirements. Schools that choose to\nconduct their own exit counseling can meet the requirement to provide borrowers with the information made available by\nthe Department in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA by providing borrowers with a copy of the Department9s\nDirect Loan Exit Counseling Guide.\nProviding Borrower Information at Separation\nSchools that conduct their own exit counseling must provide the current personal information collected from the student\n(name, address, references, etc.) to students9 loan servicers within 60 days. Students authorize their school to release\ninformation to servicers in the loan promissory note they signed. No further permission is needed.\nStudents who complete online exit counseling on the Department9s StudentAid.gov website fulfill this requirement as part\nof the counseling session; NSLDS provides the information to the loan holders.\nCounseling Methods\nThe Department offers Direct Loan Program online entrance and exit counseling for students on the StudentAid.gov\nwebsite. Your school will receive notification through the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) (see <Required Electronic\nProcesses= in Volume 2, Chapter 3 for more information) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers, and\ncompletion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If your school documents that borrowers have\ncompleted the Department9s online counseling, it has satisfied its counseling responsibility. Documentation that a\nborrower has completed the Department9s online entrance or exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan entrance or exit\ncounseling requirements.\nYour school may also choose to provide entrance or exit counseling through an in-person session or (for entrance\ncounseling) by providing a separate written form to the student that the student signs and returns to the school. If your\nschool conducts in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions\ncan help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive\nprograms to ensure that students understand the terms and conditions of their loans. Counseling materials, such as the\nentrance and exit counseling guides, are available in the Financial Aid Toolkit.\nA school may adopt an alternative approach for entrance counseling as a part of its quality assurance plan. For more\ninformation, see the regulation cited below.\nRequired Content for Exit Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(b)(4)"", 'Exit Counseling\nA Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan borrower who is graduating, leaving\nschool, or dropping below half-time enrollment is required to complete exit counseling.

You may also email the information to the student9s home (not school) email\naddress if you have it. The PDF version of the Direct Loan Exit Counseling Guide satisfies this requirement. You may also\nsend the student a direct link to the exit counseling materials online. Whatever method you choose must be used within\n30 days of learning that the borrower has withdrawn or failed to participate in an exit counseling session.\nWhen mailing exit materials to a student who has left school, you9re not required to use certified mail with a return receipt\nrequested, but you must document in their file that the materials were sent.

This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school responsibilities.']","Direct Loan borrowers, including those with adverse credit history, have specific counseling requirements that schools must adhere to. Here’s a comprehensive overview:

### Counseling Requirements for Direct Loan Borrowers

1. **Entrance Counseling**:
   - **Who Must Complete**: All first-time student borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and student Direct PLUS Loans must complete entrance counseling before receiving their first disbursement.
   - **Content Covered**: The counseling must explain:
     - The use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN).
     - The importance of the loan repayment obligation.
     - Consequences of default, including adverse credit reports and collection procedures.
     - The borrower's obligation to repay the loan regardless of program completion or employment status.
     - Sample monthly repayment amounts based on indebtedness.
     - How accepting the loan affects eligibility for other financial aid.
     - Interest accrual and capitalization.
     - The definition of half-time enrollment and its consequences.
   - **Methods of Delivery**: Counseling can be conducted in-person, online, or through written materials. Schools must ensure that students complete the counseling and may require a test or budget exercise to reinforce understanding.

2. **Exit Counseling**:
   - **Who Must Complete**: All borrowers who are graduating, leaving school, or dropping below half-time enrollment must complete exit counseling.
   - **Content Covered**: Exit counseling must inform borrowers about:

     - Options for prepayment and loan consolidation.
     - Debt management strategies.
     - Contact information for loan servicers.
     - Consequences of default and options for loan forgiveness or deferment.
   - **Methods of Delivery**: Schools can provide exit counseling materials via mail or email, or direct students to online resources. Documentation of the counseling must be maintained.

3. **Special Counseling for Adverse Credit History**:
   - **Who Must Complete**: Student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants with an adverse credit history who qualify for a loan through an endorser or by documenting extenuating circumstances must complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling.
   - **Content**: This counseling is separate from the standard entrance counseling and focuses on the implications of having an adverse credit history.

### Responsibilities of Schools
- **Documentation**: Schools must document that students have completed both entrance and exit counseling.
- **Availability of Expertise**: Schools must ensure that someone with expertise in Title IV programs is available to answer questions after counseling sessions.
- **Providing Additional Support**: Schools can offer additional financial literacy resources, such as budgeting assistance and loan repayment planning, but cannot require these as a condition for receiving loans.
- **Timely Communication**: Schools must provide exit counseling materials within 30 days of a borrower’s withdrawal or failure to participate in exit counseling.

In summary, schools play a crucial role in ensuring that Direct Loan borrowers receive the necessary counseling to understand their obligations and options, particularly for those with adverse credit histories.","First-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a Direct Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis.

If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent\nstudent (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4\nof this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate\na Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended.\nFor additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the\nFSA Handbook.\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term\nVolume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and\nnonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine\nweeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education\nprogram work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical\nWork in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below.\nIf clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard\nterm, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.\nIf a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the\nstarting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of\nthe clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on\nAugust 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not\nbegin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be\nthe beginning date of the term.\nIf the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a\nDirect Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the\ncase).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the\nspring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as\nSeptember 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which\nit is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term.\nIf loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the\nnormal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies,\nand the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of\na fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that\nfall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1\nthrough June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1\nthrough June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for\ninformation on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits).\nIf there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work,\nand the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to\nbegin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two\nloan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.', ""Regardless of the length of the loan period, you may disburse a Direct Loan in a single installment if the loan is to cover a\nstudent's COA in a study abroad program and your school9s calculated cohort default rate is less than 5% for the most\nrecent fiscal year for which data are available.\nDirect Loan Disbursements for Completed Payment Periods\nThe Direct Loan Program regulations allow a school to include in a single disbursement the disbursements for any\npayment periods that have ended. However, the COD System (except for schools exempted because of low default rates)\nrequires schools to enter at least two anticipated disbursement dates. Therefore, when creating a loan origination record\nfor a Direct Loan when you intend to include in a disbursement loan proceeds for any payment periods that have been\ncompleted, you should enter the actual date you anticipate making the disbursement as the anticipated date for all\ndisbursements that would be included. For example, consider a school attempting to submit an origination when the data\nis as follows:\nLoan period: 09/01 - 05/30 (fall through spring)\nMinimum number of disbursements normally required: 2\nPayment period 1: 09/01 - 12/20\nPayment period 2: 01/06 - 05/30\nDate school creates origination record: 01/09\nIf you anticipate disbursing the loan proceeds for both payment periods on January 16, you should enter January 16 as the\ndate for both the first and second disbursements when you create the origination record.\nDirect Loan Disbursements Made After the Date of the Borrower9s Death\nIf a school learns that a student or parent Direct Loan borrower has died before one or more disbursements of a loan have\nbeen made, the school must cancel all pending disbursements. Direct Loan funds cannot be disbursed when there is no\npossibility of repayment. In addition, if a school is not informed of a student or parent borrower9s death until after one or\nmore loan disbursements have been made, the school must return to the Department the full amount of all loan funds\nthat were credited to the student9s school account after the date of the borrower9s death (if the post-death disbursement\ncreated a credit balance that was paid directly to the student or parent, the school is not responsible for returning the\ncredit balance amount).\nDisbursements after the date of the borrower9s death are most likely to occur when a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower\ndies. If an enrolled student dies, the school will generally learn of the death in a timely manner and can cancel any\npending loan disbursements. However, if a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower dies, the student or other family members\nStudy Abroad Program Exception\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(6)(i)(B)\nDirect Loan Disbursement After One or More Payment Periods Have Elapsed\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(4)(i)"", 'information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form\nIf you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information\nsections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the\nstudent, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up\nto the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent\nsecond-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume\nfor information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of\nthe other Title IV programs.\nSelf-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or\nhave refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated\nstatement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students\nwithout parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide.\nDirect PLUS Loans\nDirect PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate\nstudents.\nA parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who\nmeets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a\nstudent. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is\nineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent\nwho had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements\noutlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal\ngovernment holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s\nineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student\nis otherwise eligible.\nRequirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers\nSchools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan\nProgram and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available\nto both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students. For more information, see the\ndiscussion under <Direct PLUS Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDefinition of <Parent= for Direct PLUS Loan Purposes\nIf they meet all other Direct PLUS Loan eligibility requirements, the following individuals can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on\nbehalf of a dependent undergraduate student:\nThe student9s biological parent;\nThe student9s legal adoptive parent; or\nThe student9s stepparent (spouse of the student9s biological or legal adoptive parent at the time of application), but\nonly if the stepparent is required to provide their information on the FAFSA form in accordance with the instructions\non the FAFSA form.\nGrandparents and other family members are not eligible to take out Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent\nundergraduate student unless they have legally adopted the student.\nIn addition to the parent(s) whose resources are reported on a student9s FAFSA form, any otherwise eligible biological or\nlegal adoptive parent of the dependent undergraduate student can also take out a Direct PLUS Loan on the student9s\nbehalf, even if that parent9s information is not reported on the FAFSA form.\nNote also that more than one parent can take out a Direct PLUS Loan on behalf of the same dependent undergraduate', 'student. For example, if a student9s biological or legal adoptive parents are divorced, they may decide to each take out a\nDirect PLUS Loan for an agreed upon amount (not to exceed the student9s COA, minus other financial assistance (OFA)) to\nhelp pay for the cost of the student9s education.\nRequirement for Dependent Students To File a FAFSA Form\nIn all cases, the dependent student on whose behalf a parent has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan must have filed a FAFSA\nform and received an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or FAFSA Submission Summary (see Chapter 1 of the\nApplication and Verification Guide for information on the ISIR and FAFSA Submission Summary). This requirement ensures\nthat student eligibility data matches are conducted to verify that the dependent student on whose behalf the parent is\nborrowing:\nIs not in default on a Title IV loan and does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant;\nHas had their Social Security number verified by the Social Security Administration; and\nHas had their citizenship status confirmed by either the Social Security Administration or the Department of\nHomeland Security.\nNote that this requirement is for the student to submit a FAFSA form. It is not a requirement for the parent borrower to\nsubmit a FAFSA form in the parent9s name, and it does not preclude an otherwise eligible parent whose information is not\nincluded on the FAFSA form (sometimes referred to as a <non-custodial= parent) from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan.\nBefore originating a Direct PLUS Loan for a parent borrower, schools must review the ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary\nof the dependent student to ensure there are no student eligibility issues that must be resolved before the parent can\nreceive the Direct PLUS Loan.\nAdverse Credit History\nAn individual with an adverse credit history is prohibited from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan unless they meet additional\neligibility requirements. The Department obtains a credit report on each student or parent applicant for a Direct PLUS\nLoan. An applicant is considered to have an adverse credit history if:\nThey have one or more debts with a total combined outstanding balance greater than $2,085 that (1) are 90 or more\ndays delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or (2) have been placed in collection or charged-off during the two\nyears preceding the date of the credit report; or\nDuring the five years preceding the date of the credit report, the applicant has been determined to be in default on a\ndebt; has had debts discharged in bankruptcy; or has been the subject of foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage\ngarnishment, or write-off of a Title IV debt.\nFor Direct PLUS Loan eligibility purposes, <charged-off= means a debt that has been written off as a loss, but that is still\nsubject to collection action. <In collection= means a debt that has been placed with a collection agency by a creditor or\nthat is subject to more intensive efforts by a creditor to recover amounts owed from a borrower who has not responded\nsatisfactorily to the routine demands of the creditor9s billing procedures.\nAn applicant cannot be denied a Direct PLUS Loan because they have no credit history. That is, the absence of a credit\nhistory is not considered to be adverse credit.\nThere are two means by which a Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit history can still qualify for a Direct\nPLUS Loan. One option is for the applicant to obtain an endorser who doesn9t have an adverse credit history. An endorser\nis someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower doesn9t repay it. For a parent borrower, the\nendorser may not be the dependent student for whom the parent is borrowing.\nAs an alternative to obtaining an endorser, an applicant who has been determined to have an adverse credit history may\nalso qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan by submitting documentation to the Department showing that there are extenuating\ncircumstances associated with the adverse credit. The Department has the final decision on determining whether\nextenuating circumstances exist.\nA borrower who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting to the satisfaction of the\nDepartment that extenuating circumstances exist must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling, as discussed below.', 'If your school participates in the Direct PLUS program but a student9s parent cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the\nstudent is allowed to borrow additional unsubsidized funds (see <Criteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan Funds= in Chapter 4 of this volume).\nRequired Counseling for Direct PLUS Loan Applicants With Adverse Credit\nAny student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has an adverse credit history but qualifies by obtaining an endorser\nor documenting that there are extenuating circumstances must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling on the\nDepartment9s StudentAid.gov website.\nAdverse Credit History and Default\nAlthough a default on a Title IV loan will generally appear in a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant9s credit record\nand result in the individual being determined to have an adverse credit history, being in default on a Title IV loan and\nhaving an adverse credit history are separate eligibility issues. A Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified through the\nDepartment9s National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as being in default on a Title IV loan and who has also been\ndetermined to have an adverse credit history (due to the default and/or other adverse credit conditions) cannot qualify for\na Direct PLUS Loan simply by obtaining an endorser or by providing acceptable documentation of extenuating\ncircumstances. The applicant must also separately resolve the default status by one of the means discussed under\n<Resolving Default Status= in Volume 1, Chapter 3.\nIn some cases, the Direct PLUS Loan credit check may not reveal a default on a Title IV loan, particularly if the default is\nnot recent. If a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified in NSLDS as being in default on a Title IV\nloan does not have any other adverse credit issues, the applicant will pass the PLUS credit check. In this circumstance you\ncannot assume that the approved credit check result supersedes the information in NSLDS. The default must be resolved\nbefore you can disburse Direct PLUS Loan funds or other Title IV aid to the applicant.\nDirect PLUS Loan Application\nSchools that offer Direct PLUS Loans have the option of requiring student and parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants to\ncomplete the Direct PLUS Loan Application (formally known as the ""Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request for Supplemental\nInformation"") on the Department\'s StudentAid.gov website as the first step in applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. The Direct\nPLUS Loan Application collects the requested loan amount, the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended, and\nother information related to processing the requested Direct PLUS Loan.\nUse of the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov is not required. Schools may choose to develop their own\nprocesses for obtaining the information needed to originate Direct PLUS Loans.\nAlthough the Department9s FAFSA Processing System (FPS) matches student Direct PLUS Loan applicants against NSLDS\nto determine if they are in default on a Title IV loan, it does not perform this match for parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants.\nHowever, the Department conducts an NSLDS default check on all Direct PLUS Loan applicants (both students and\nparents) who complete the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov.\nSchools that use the Direct PLUS Loan Application are notified of the result of the NSLDS default check through the\nCommon Origination and Disbursement (COD) System. The result is reported as one of the following values:\n""N"" = The borrower is not in default on any Title IV loan.\nDefinition of <Adverse Credit History=\n34 CFR 685.200(c)(2)(viii)(B)\n34 CFR 685.200(b)(5)', ""If you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower has received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of their\nfinancial need, and the student is still enrolled for the loan period, you must return the subsidized loan amount for which\nthe student was ineligible and ask the student if they wish to replace the subsidized funds with a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan. If the student agrees to accept the unsubsidized loan funds and they also received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for\nthe same loan period as the Direct Subsidized Loan, you may increase the amount of the Direct Unsubsidized Loan\ndisbursements by the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. If the student did\nnot receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you may originate a new Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the amount of the Direct\nSubsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. The new Direct Unsubsidized Loan must have the same loan\nperiod and disbursement dates as the Direct Subsidized Loan.\nIf the student does not agree to have the excess subsidized loan funds replaced by a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must\nstill return the ineligible Direct Subsidized Loan amount.\nIf you discover that a student received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of financial need after the student is no\nlonger enrolled for the loan period, you are not required to take any action to eliminate the excess subsidized loan\namount.\nIf you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower who was eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan instead received a\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan, you must correct the error (even if the loan period has ended) by submitting a downward\nadjustment to reduce or eliminate the Direct Unsubsidized Loan, as appropriate, and replacing it with the same amount of\nDirect Subsidized Loan funds. You may do this either by adjusting an existing Direct Subsidized Loan upwards, or, if the\nstudent does not have an existing Direct Subsidized Loan, by originating a new Direct Subsidized Loan. Replacing a Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan with a Direct Subsidized Loan in this circumstance does not require obtaining the student9s consent.\nDirect Loan Overawards\nAs explained in Volume 4, Chapter 3, an overaward exists when a student9s aid package exceeds their need or overall\nCOA. If you discover that a student who received Direct Loans has been overawarded and your school has already\nreceived and disbursed some or all of the Direct Loan funds, you have the following options:\nIf the student9s aid package includes a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, or a nonfederal education loan,\nand the aid package doesn9t already apply these loans toward the student9s SAI, you may choose to adjust the aid\npackage to have all or a portion of these loans replace the SAI, thus reducing or eliminating the overaward (for more\ndetail and examples, see <Substituting for the SAI= in Volume 3, Chapter 3).\nIf you have not yet made the second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan, you can reduce or cancel the\nsecond or subsequent disbursement.\nIf the overaward situation occurs after the full amount of a Direct Loan has been disbursed, you do not need to adjust the\namount of the loan. However, you might have to adjust the aid package to prevent an overaward of Campus-Based funds\nor to prevent the total aid package from exceeding the student9s need.\nAlthough a school isn9t required to return Direct Loan funds that were disbursed to the borrower (either directly or by\napplying them to the student's account) before the overaward situation occurred, the law doesn9t prevent your school\nfrom returning funds that were applied to the student account if you choose to do so. A borrower who receives a direct\npayment of loan funds is not required to repay an overawarded amount, unless the overaward was caused by the\nborrower9s misreporting or withholding of information.\nLoan Periods\nThe loan period (also referred to as the <period of enrollment=) is the period for which a Direct Loan is intended. It must\ncoincide with an academic period established by the school for which institutional charges are generally assessed (e.g.,\nsemester, trimester, quarter, length of the student9s program, or academic year). It9s important to define the loan period\nat the beginning of the loan awarding process, because the timing and amount of Direct Loan disbursements are tied to\nthe loan period.\nGenerally, the loan period may not include terms in which a student is ineligible (for example, if the student is not enrolled\nduring a particular term or is enrolled less than half time during a term). There is a limited exception to this rule if the loan\nperiod begins and ends with a term in which the student is eligible for Direct Loans, but the first and last terms of the loan""]","['<1-hop>\n\nmay not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of payments while the student was enrolled at least half time. If a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death, the school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent student (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4 of this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.', '<2-hop>\n\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and nonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","Exceptions to the normal loan period for Direct PLUS Loans apply when clinical work is involved in a student's program. If clinical work meets specific criteria to be included in a standard term or substantially equal nonstandard term (SE9W), the school must adjust the loan period dates accordingly. For instance, if clinical work begins before the term starts, the loan period start date is set to the beginning of the clinical work. Conversely, if the clinical work ends after the term's official end date, the loan period end date is adjusted to the end of the clinical work. This ensures that the loan period accurately reflects the time the student is engaged in educational activities, including clinical work.

Regarding the implications if a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passes away, the school must cancel any pending disbursements if they learn of the borrower's death before disbursement. If disbursements have already been made after the date of the borrower's death, the school is required to return those funds to the Department of Education. Additionally, if the deceased parent had requested a deferment while the student was enrolled at least half-time, the school may not be notified immediately, which could complicate the situation. If the school must return funds disbursed after the parent's death, they may consider whether a surviving parent can take out a new Direct PLUS Loan or award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has technically ended. 

These provisions ensure that students can continue to receive financial support for their education despite the unfortunate circumstance of a parent's death.","Exceptions to the normal loan period apply to Direct PLUS Loans when clinical work is involved by allowing the loan period start date to be the beginning date of the clinical work if it starts before the term, and the loan period end date to be the ending date of the clinical work if it ends after the term. This adjustment ensures that the loan period accurately reflects the duration of the clinical work. In the event that a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passes away, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended.

"What are the requirements for entrance counseling for first-time Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers, and how does this relate to the overall Direct Loan counseling process?","['Chapter 2\nDirect Loan Counseling\nCounseling Overview\nFirst-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a\nDirect Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled\non at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default. Your school can also offer financial literacy classes, on a credit or non-credit basis, that include\ninformation on budgeting, debt management, anticipated earnings by profession, elements of loan counseling, etc.,\nthough eligibility for a Direct Loan cannot be contingent on completion of such a class.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrowers\nBelow we provide a summary of the information that must be covered in entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan\nand Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers.

You can also reinforce messages to borrowers. For example, with each\ndisbursement you can remind students about the importance of maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP; see\nVolume 1, Chapter 1 for details on SAP requirements), planning for future employment, and staying in touch with the loan\nservicer. Sample measures for loan counseling are given in the <Sample Default Prevention Plan= that can be found in the\nregulations cited below.\nPLUS Loan Credit Counseling\nSpecial loan counseling is required for any student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has been determined to\nhave an adverse credit history, but who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan either by getting a loan endorser or by\ndocumenting to the satisfaction of the Department that there are extenuating circumstances related to the adverse\ncredit. While the special PLUS Loan Credit Counseling is mandatory only for these borrowers, any PLUS borrower can\nvoluntarily complete this counseling.

There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers who meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit history. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school responsibilities.', '<2-hop>\n\nEntrance Counseling Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. For this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student who requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before the authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan to a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling. Entrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are about to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person counseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. If entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable steps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the terms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the borrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic document. Your school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance education, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed. You may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance counseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements are reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that unreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling can include one or more of the following: Extra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods; A requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though you cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan); A requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or A requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.']","For first-time Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers, entrance counseling is a mandatory requirement before they can receive their first disbursement of the loan. This requirement applies to all first-time borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and student Direct PLUS Loans. However, it does not apply to parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.

### Requirements for Entrance Counseling:
1. **Definition of First-Time Borrower**: A first-time borrower is defined as someone who has not previously received a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan.

2. **Content of Counseling**: The entrance counseling must cover several key topics, including:
   - The use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN).
   - The importance of the loan repayment obligation.
   - Consequences of default, including adverse credit reports and collection procedures.
   - The borrower's obligation to repay the loan regardless of their educational outcomes.
   - Sample monthly repayment amounts based on different levels of indebtedness.
   - How accepting the loan affects eligibility for other financial aid.
   - Information on interest accrual and capitalization.
   - The definition of half-time enrollment and its implications.
   - Importance of contacting the school if the borrower withdraws.

3. **Delivery Methods**: Counseling can be conducted in various formats:
   - In-person sessions.
   - Written forms that the borrower signs and returns.
   - Online or interactive electronic means, with a requirement for the borrower to acknowledge receipt of the information.

4. **Completion Verification**: Schools must ensure that students complete the counseling, which may include a test to assess their understanding of the loan terms. Schools must also have someone available to answer questions after the counseling session.

5. **Documentation**: Schools are required to document that the student has completed the entrance counseling.

### Relation to Overall Direct Loan Counseling Process:
Entrance counseling is part of a broader Direct Loan counseling process that also includes exit counseling, which is required for all Direct Loan borrowers before they cease enrollment at least half-time. While entrance counseling focuses on informing borrowers about their responsibilities and the terms of their loans before they receive funds, exit counseling provides information on repayment options and obligations as borrowers prepare to leave school.

In summary, entrance counseling is a critical step for first-time borrowers to ensure they understand their loan commitments and responsibilities, which is essential for their financial literacy and successful loan repayment.","Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers. This counseling provides comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan and the borrower's responsibility to repay it. It can be conducted in-person, through written forms, or online, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. Schools must ensure that students complete the counseling, which may include a test of their understanding. This requirement is part of the broader Direct Loan counseling process, which also includes exit counseling for all student Direct Loan borrowers before they cease to be enrolled at least half-time. The overall process ensures that borrowers are informed about their loans and responsibilities, aligning with the school's responsibilities to guide students through their financial aid options.",1.0,1.0,0.63,0.9592861854206531,0.49999999916666665,,13.472986221313477,multi_query_rag
How do student loan eligibility criteria and minimum loan periods interact when a student is ineligible for a term within a fall-winter-spring academic year?,"['period are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be\nenrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and\nspring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be\nenrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering\nthe fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s\nCOA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a\nschool initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of\nat least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily\ndrops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not\nrequired to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school\nto adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and\nspring quarters only.\nIn the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-\nonly loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring\nloan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would\nthen be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining\nthe student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods\nOther Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a\nstudent9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs\nassociated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the\nfall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine\nmonths.\nThe limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last\nterms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period.\nFor instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall\nterm or the spring term.\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when\nperiods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\nMinimum Loan Periods\nThe minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar.\nAs explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a\nDirect Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on\nwhether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard\nor nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the\ncase of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below.\nNonstandard terms may be one of the following types:\n1. \nNonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any\nother term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length.\nSE9W\nPeriod of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition\n34 CFR 685.102(b)', '2. \nNonstandard terms that are substantially equal, but one or more of the terms in the academic year\ncontains fewer than nine weeks.\nNon-\nSE9W\n3. \nNonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length (one or more of the terms in the academic\nyear differs in length from another term by more than two weeks).\nNon-\nSE9W\nWe refer to the first type of nonstandard term as <SE9W= nonstandard terms. We group the second and third types\ntogether and refer to them as <non-SE9W= nonstandard terms.\nPrograms with SE9W nonstandard terms are treated the same as standard-term programs for purposes of determining\nminimum loan period length and monitoring annual loan limits. However, programs with non-SE9W nonstandard terms are\ntreated the same as non-term programs for these purposes.\nNote that substantially equal nonstandard terms (the first two types of nonstandard terms described above) are treated\ndifferently for purposes of determining Direct Loan payment periods than for determining minimum loan period length\nand monitoring annual loan limits. As explained in Volume 1, Chapter 1, if a program is offered in standard terms or in\nnonstandard terms that are substantially equal in length (regardless of the length of the nonstandard term), the payment\nperiod is the term.\nHowever, for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and monitoring Direct Loan annual loan\nlimits, substantially equal nonstandard terms that contain fewer than nine weeks are treated the same as nonstandard\nterms that are not substantially equal. This means that if a program has substantially equal nonstandard terms that are\nless than nine weeks in length, you must make a Direct Loan disbursement each term (the same as would be the case if\nthe program were offered in standard terms), but the minimum loan period and the type of academic year used to\nmonitor Direct Loan annual loan limits must be determined in accordance with the rules that apply to non-term programs.\nFor detailed information on standard term, nonstandard term, and non-term programs, see Volume 1, Chapter 1.\nMinimum Loan Period: Standard Term and SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\nFor credit-hour programs with standard terms (semesters, quarters, or trimesters), or with SE9W\nnonstandard terms, the minimum loan period is a single academic term. For example, if a student will be enrolled in the\nfall semester only and will skip the spring semester, you may originate a loan with a loan period that covers only the fall\nterm.\nMinimum Loan Period: Clock-Hour, Non-Term, and Non-SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\nFor all other programs (i.e., clock-hour, non-term, and non-SE9W nonstandard term programs), the minimum\nloan period is generally the lesser of the program length (or remainder of the program, if there is less than full academic\nyear remaining) or the academic year. There are exceptions to this minimum loan period rule when originating loans for\ntransfer students, or for students who complete or otherwise cease enrollment in one program and then begin a different\nprogram at the same school. We discuss these exceptions in detail in Chapter 7 of this volume.\nMinimum Loan Period: Programs Offered in Modules\nIf a program is offered in modules, this does not change the minimum loan period rules for Direct Loans. For example, if a\nstandard or SE9W nonstandard term is divided into two or more modules, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is\nstill the term, even if the student does not attend all modules within the term. Similarly, if a clock-hour, non-term credit-\nMinimum Loan Period\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(10)(i)', 'hour, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is offered in modules, the minimum loan period is still the lesser of the\nacademic year or the program length (or remaining portion of the program).\nFor Title IV aid purposes, students are allowed to skip one or more modules. However, if a loan period includes modules\nthat the student does not attend, the COA for the loan period may not include costs associated with those modules.\nMinimum Loan Period: Standard Term Combined With an Intersession\nAs we explain under <Intersessions= in Volume 3, Chapter 1, in limited cases for academic programs offered in standard\nterms, a short nonstandard term (often called an <intersession=) may be combined with a preceding or following standard\nterm and considered to be a single standard term. In such cases, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is different\ndepending on whether a student attends the intersession. If a student who attends the intersession requests a loan for the\ncombined term, the loan period includes the standard term plus the intersession. However, if the student attends only the\nstandard term and is not enrolled in the intersession that is attached to that term, the loan period includes only the\nstandard term.\nMaximum Loan Periods\nThe maximum period for which you may originate a Direct Loan is generally an academic year. However, if your school\napplies the annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans to a period of time greater than\nan academic year, you may originate a Direct Loan for that longer period of time. For example, a school might offer an\n1100 clock-hour program and define the academic year as 900 clock hours but could choose to allow students to receive\njust one annual loan limit for the entire 1100-hour program. In that case, the loan period would correspond to the length\nof the program, a period of time that is longer than the academic year.\nDirect Loan Disbursement Requirements\nFor general guidance on the timing of disbursements made under the Title IV programs, see Volume 3, Chapter 1. For\nguidance on reporting Title IV program disbursements through the COD System and the rules for making early\ndisbursements, late disbursements, and retroactive payments, see Volume 4, Chapter 2. In this section we discuss certain\nother disbursement requirements that are specific to the Direct Loan Program.\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal Direct Loan disbursement\nrequirements that apply when periods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\nRequirement for Substantially Equal Disbursements\nDirect Loans must be disbursed in substantially equal installments, regardless of any difference in costs for different\npayment periods that are within the same loan period, and no Direct Loan disbursement may exceed one-half of the loan\nMaximum Loan Period\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(10)(iv)\nDetermining Direct Loan Disbursement Dates and Amounts\n34 CFR 685.303(d)', 'COA (see Volume 3, Chapter 3);\nFor parents receiving a Direct PLUS Loan, ensure that the student has completed a FAFSA form (review the student9s\nISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary); and\nEnsure that the loan disbursement dates meet cash management and disbursement requirements.\nFor a Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loan, you must also:\nDetermine the student9s Pell Grant eligibility and, if they are eligible, include the grant in the student9s aid package;\nFor a Direct Unsubsidized Loan made to an undergraduate student, first determine the student9s eligibility for a\nDirect Subsidized Loan and, if the student is eligible, include the Direct Subsidized Loan in the student9s aid package;\nEnsure that the amount of the loan will not exceed the student9s annual or aggregate loan limits; and\nProrate the annual loan limit for an undergraduate enrolled in a program or remaining period of study that is shorter\nthan an academic year (as described in Chapter 5 of this volume).\nNo Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods Other Than Nine Months\nIf you originate a Direct Loan for a period shorter than a full academic year (for example, a loan for a single term or for a\nprogram shorter than an academic year), the loan amount must be based on the reduced costs for that shorter period of\nenrollment rather than the costs for the full academic year. However, as explained in Volume 3, Chapter 3, there are no\nalternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months comparable to the alternate EFCs for periods other than\nnine months that were used prior to the 2024-2025 award year. In all cases you must use the student9s full calculated 9-\nmonth SAI in the formula to determine financial need for Direct Subsidized Loans and other need-based aid even though\nthe COA will reflect the reduced costs for the shorter loan period. This means that students enrolled for periods shorter\nthan nine months will have less financial need than would have been the case in the past when using a smaller alternate\nEFC, because now the full calculated SAI must be subtracted from the reduced COA for the shorter period of enrollment\nwhen determining financial need for purposes of Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility.\nVolume 8, Chapter 3, Example 1: Effect of No Alternate SAI on Financial Need When Originating Loans for Periods\nLess Than Nine Months\nA first-year dependent student has a COA of $10,800 for an academic year consisting of the fall and spring\nsemesters and an SAI of 8,000, so the student9s financial need for the fall-spring enrollment period is $2,800 (see\nVolume 3, Chapter 3 for guidance on determining financial need). The student is not eligible for a Pell Grant and\nreceives no Title IV aid except for Direct Loans. The student qualifies for a $2,800 Direct Subsidized Loan to fully\ncover their financial need. (The student could also receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, but for purposes of this\nexample we cover only Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility.)\nThe student will also be enrolled for the summer term, which the school treats as a <trailer= to the preceding fall-\nspring Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) for purposes of monitoring annual loan limits (see Chapter 6 of this\nVolume). The summer term is four months in length and the COA for that term is $4,000. For students who attend\nthe summer term and request Direct Loan funds, the school9s normal practice is to originate a separate loan for\nthe summer term only. Because there is no alternate SAI for periods of enrollment less than nine months and the\nstudent9s SAI of 8,000 is greater than the summer term COA, the student has no financial need for summer and is\ntherefore ineligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan for that term (but could receive a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan).\nAs an alternative to originating a separate summer-only loan, the school could choose to originate a single loan\nfor a loan period covering the fall-spring SAY plus the summer trailer term.

For example, if a student is expected to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and spring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be enrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering the fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s COA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a school initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of at least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily drops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not required to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school to adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and spring quarters only. In the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring- only loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring loan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would then be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining the student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods Other Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a student9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs associated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the fall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months. The limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last terms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period. For instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall term or the spring term. Note: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when periods of clinical work are included in a standard term.', '<2-hop>\n\nMinimum Loan Periods The minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar. As explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on whether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard or nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the case of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below. Nonstandard terms may be one of the following types: 1. Nonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any other term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length. SE9W Period of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition 34 CFR 685.102(b)']","When a student is ineligible for a term within a fall-winter-spring academic year, the interaction between student loan eligibility criteria and minimum loan periods is governed by specific rules outlined in the context.

1. **Loan Period Origination**: If a student is expected to be enrolled at least half-time in the fall and spring quarters but indicates they will not attend the winter quarter (or will be enrolled less than half-time), the school can still originate a loan for the entire fall-winter-spring period. However, costs associated with the winter quarter cannot be included in the calculation of the loan amount for the fall and spring quarters.

2. **Adjustments to Loan Amounts**: If a school initially originates a loan for the fall-winter-spring period based on the student's anticipated enrollment status but the student later does not attend the winter quarter or drops below half-time status, the school is not required to change the original loan period. However, it may need to adjust the loan amount based on the reduced costs for the fall and spring quarters only.

3. **Separate Loan Options**: The school has the option to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-only periods if the student is ineligible for the winter term. In this case, the school must subtract the student's full SAI (Student Aid Index) from the costs for both the fall and spring terms when determining eligibility for Direct Subsidized Loans.

4. **Eligibility Criteria**: A key point is that the student must be eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last terms of the loan period. If the student is ineligible for the fall or spring term, the school cannot originate a loan for that fall-winter-spring period.

5. **Proration of Loan Limits**: If the student’s final period of study is shorter than an academic year due to not attending a term, the annual loan limit must be prorated based on the hours the student is expected to attend. For example, if a student is enrolled full-time in the fall but less than half-time in the winter and does not attend spring, the loan period may only cover the fall quarter, and the loan limit would be calculated based on that enrollment.

In summary, when a student is ineligible for a term, schools can still originate loans for the entire academic year but must adjust the loan amounts accordingly and ensure that eligibility criteria are met for the first and last terms of the loan period.","Student loan eligibility criteria allow a school to originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring period even if a student is ineligible for one of the terms, such as the winter quarter, provided the student is eligible during the first and last terms of the loan period. However, no costs associated with the ineligible term can be included in the student's Cost of Attendance (COA) when determining the loan amount. The minimum loan period for originating a Direct Loan depends on the school's academic calendar and whether the program is term-based or non-term. For term-based programs with nonstandard terms, the terms must be substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length. This interaction ensures that while students can receive loans for eligible terms, the loan amounts must be adjusted to reflect only the periods of eligibility, adhering to the minimum loan period requirements.",1.0,0.875,0.48,0.9501831829039545,0.1999999998,,13.949826002120972,multi_query_rag
"How does proration apply to students in clock-hour programs when their remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year, and what are some examples of this proration process?","['Graduate Early From a Clock-Hour Program= later in this chapter).\nIn a standard-term program, or a credit-hour program using SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of\nstudy is considered shorter than an academic year if the remaining period contains fewer terms than the number of terms\ncovered by the school9s Title IV academic year. For programs that are offered in a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY; see\nChapter 6), the number of terms covered in the school9s Title IV academic year usually does not include a summer\n<header= or <trailer= term.\nConsider a student who is enrolled in a four-year program that is offered in an SAY consisting of three quarters plus a\nsummer trailer, and who has completed four academic years of study. The student needs to attend an additional quarter\nterm to complete the program requirements. The final quarter term falls in a new academic year; therefore the annual\nloan limit must be prorated because the remaining period of study (a single quarter) is less than a full academic year.\nSimilarly, if a student enrolled in a two-year program not offered in an SAY (where the Title IV academic year covers two\n15-week semesters) has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to\ncomplete the program requirements, the loan limit must be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester.\nNote that for standard-term programs or credit-hour programs with SE9W nonstandard terms, the length of the loan\nperiod does not determine whether a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic\nyear. The determining factor is the length of the remaining period of study in which the student is enrolled, which may not\nbe the same as the loan period. For example, if an undergraduate student is enrolled for a full SAY consisting of fall and\nspring semesters, and will complete the program at the end of the spring term, but is enrolled less than half time during\nthe spring, the student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan only for the fall semester. Although the loan period (fall only) is\nshorter than an academic year, the remaining period of study (fall through spring) is a full academic year. Therefore, if the\nstudent receives a Direct Loan in the fall, proration of the annual loan limit is not required.\nIn a clock-hour program, non-term program, or a program with non-SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining\nperiod of study is considered less than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program9s\ndefined Title IV academic year. In contrast to standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, if a student enrolled\nin a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is in a remaining period of study shorter than an\nacademic year and receives a Direct Loan, the loan period and the remaining period of study will always be the same. This\nis because for these programs the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program (or remaining portion of\na program) or the academic year.\nFor all types of programs, you determine the prorated loan limit for a student enrolled in a remaining period of study less\nthan an academic year by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by the following fraction:\nUnlike proration for programs that are shorter than an academic year, there is no comparison of weeks and hours. Only\nthe credit or clock hours that the student is scheduled to attend, or is actually attending, at the time of\norigination are used in the calculation.\nProration Examples: Remaining Periods of Study Shorter Than an Academic Year\nExamples 3 through 7 illustrate how the prorated annual loan limit is determined when a student is enrolled in a\nremaining period of study shorter than an academic year.\nSemester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours enrolled in program\nSemester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours in academic year\nVolume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3: Remaining Period = One Quarter', 'Chapter 5\nLoan Limit Proration\nProration Overview\nThe annual maximum loan amount an undergraduate student may receive must be prorated (reduced) when the borrower\nis:\nEnrolled in a program that is shorter than a full academic year; or\nEnrolled in a program that is one academic year or more in length but is in a remaining period of study (a period of\nstudy at the end of which a student will have completed all requirements of the program) that is shorter than a full\nacademic year.\nWith one exception (see ""Proration of the Annual Loan Limit for Students who Graduate Early From Clock-Hour Programs""\nlater in this chapter), the annual loan limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are prorated only\nin these two situations. Loan limits are not prorated based on a student9s enrollment status, such as when a student is\nenrolled less than full time, or when a student is enrolled for a period of less than a full academic year that is not a\nremaining period of study.\nThe annual loan limit for Direct Unsubsidized Loans is not prorated for students enrolled in graduate or professional level\nprograms. Loan proration requirements also do not apply to students taking preparatory coursework or coursework\nnecessary for teacher certification. This is because the annual loan limit must be prorated only when a student is enrolled\nin a program or remaining portion of a program that is shorter than an academic year. Students taking preparatory\ncoursework or teacher certification coursework are not considered to be enrolled in a program for purposes of awarding\nTitle IV aid.\nIt9s important to understand that loan limit proration determines the maximum loan amount that a student may borrow\nfor a program or remaining balance of a program, not the actual loan amount a student is eligible to receive. In some\ncases, the loan amount a student is eligible to receive (based on costs, SAI, and OFA) may be less than the prorated loan\nlimit.\nUse of Fractions vs. Decimals When Prorating Loan Limits\nAs we explain in more detail below, proration involves multiplying the annual loan limit by a fraction. You may choose to\nconvert the fraction to a decimal and then multiply the annual loan limit by the decimal, but this conversion is not a\nrequirement. However, you should be consistent in the method you use, since the fraction and decimal calculations\nsometimes result in slightly different prorated loan limits, as shown in the examples later in the chapter.\nUsing the School9s Academic Year Definition If Longer Than the Title IV Minimum\nAs explained above, proration of the annual loan limit is required when an undergraduate student is enrolled in a program\nthat is shorter than an academic year or is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year.\nA school may choose to define its academic year as longer in weeks or hours than the minimum statutory requirements. If\nso, the school9s standard 3 not the statutory minimum 3 determines whether a program or a final period of study is shorter\nthan an academic year.\nSeparate Calculations for the Combined Subsidized and Unsubsidized Annual Loan Limit and the Maximum Subsidized\nLoan Limit Proration\n34 CFR 685.203(a), (b), (c)', 'Prorating Loan Limits for Remaining Periods Shorter Than an Academic Year\nYou must also prorate loan limits for students enrolled in remaining periods of study shorter than an academic year. This\ncircumstance can occur when a student is enrolled in a program that is one academic year or more in length, but the\nremaining period of study needed to complete the program (sometimes called a <final= period of study) will be shorter\nthan an academic year.\nProration is required only when you know in advance that a student will be enrolled for a remaining period of study that is\nshorter than an academic year. With one exception, if a student originally enrolls for a remaining period of study that is a\nfull academic year in length, but completes the program in less than a full academic year, there is no requirement to\nretroactively prorate the annual loan limit (for the exception, see <Proration of the Annual Loan Limit for Students Who\nTo determine the maximum portion of the $2,420 prorated annual loan limit that the student may receive in\nsubsidized loan funds, multiply the maximum subsidized annual loan limit of $3,500 by the smaller decimal\n(0.44):\n$3,500 x 0.44 = $1,540 subsidized prorated annual loan limit\nThe maximum combined Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount the student can borrow for\nthe program is $2,420, but no more than $1,540 of this amount may be in subsidized loans.\nNote: In Example 1 above and in the other proration examples that follow, the fractions are converted to\ndecimals. As an alternative you could choose to multiply the annual loan limit by the original fraction, though you\nshould be consistent in using one method or the other. Using the fraction 400/900 in Example 1 instead of the\ndecimal 0.44 would result in a slightly higher prorated loan limit: $5,500 x 400/900 = $2,444.\nVolume 8, Chapter 5, Example 2: Non-Term Credit-Hour Program Shorter Than an Academic Year\nAn independent student is enrolled in a 24 quarter-hour, 20-week program.

Similarly, if a student enrolled in a two-year program not offered in an SAY (where the Title IV academic year covers two 15-week semesters) has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to complete the program requirements, the loan limit must be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester. Note that for standard-term programs or credit-hour programs with SE9W nonstandard terms, the length of the loan period does not determine whether a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year. The determining factor is the length of the remaining period of study in which the student is enrolled, which may not be the same as the loan period. For example, if an undergraduate student is enrolled for a full SAY consisting of fall and spring semesters, and will complete the program at the end of the spring term, but is enrolled less than half time during the spring, the student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan only for the fall semester. Although the loan period (fall only) is shorter than an academic year, the remaining period of study (fall through spring) is a full academic year. Therefore, if the student receives a Direct Loan in the fall, proration of the annual loan limit is not required. In a clock-hour program, non-term program, or a program with non-SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of study is considered less than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program9s defined Title IV academic year. In contrast to standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, if a student enrolled in a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is in a remaining period of study shorter than an academic year and receives a Direct Loan, the loan period and the remaining period of study will always be the same. This is because for these programs the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program (or remaining portion of a program) or the academic year. For all types of programs, you determine the prorated loan limit for a student enrolled in a remaining period of study less than an academic year by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by the following fraction: Unlike proration for programs that are shorter than an academic year, there is no comparison of weeks and hours. Only the credit or clock hours that the student is scheduled to attend, or is actually attending, at the time of origination are used in the calculation.', '<2-hop>\n\nProration Examples: Remaining Periods of Study Shorter Than an Academic Year Examples 3 through 7 illustrate how the prorated annual loan limit is determined when a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study shorter than an academic year. Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours enrolled in program Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours in academic year Volume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3: Remaining Period = One Quarter']","Proration applies to students in clock-hour programs when their remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year by reducing the annual loan limit based on the number of clock hours they are scheduled to attend compared to the total clock hours defined in the program's academic year.

In clock-hour programs, if a student is in a remaining period of study that consists of fewer clock hours than the program's defined Title IV academic year, the loan limit must be prorated. The proration is calculated by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by a fraction that represents the ratio of the clock hours the student is scheduled to attend to the total clock hours in the academic year.

### Examples of the Proration Process:

1. **Example of a Short Clock-Hour Program**:
   - A student is enrolled in a 400 clock-hour, 12-week program, while the school defines the academic year as 900 clock hours and 26 weeks. 
   - The calculation for proration would be:
     - **Weeks**: 12 weeks in program / 26 weeks in academic year = 0.46
     - **Hours**: 400 hours in program / 900 hours in academic year = 0.44
     - The smaller decimal (0.44) is used to determine the prorated loan limit:
       - $5,500 (annual loan limit) x 0.44 = $2,420 (combined subsidized and unsubsidized prorated annual loan limit).

2. **Example of a Remaining Quarter**:
   - A student in a two-year credit-hour program has completed six quarters (two academic years) and needs to complete an additional six hours in the fall quarter of the next academic year.
   - The school defines the academic year as 36 quarter hours. The calculation would be:
     - 6 hours in fall / 36 hours in academic year = 0.17
     - $6,500 (annual loan limit for a second-year undergraduate) x 0.17 = $1,105 (combined prorated annual loan limit).
     - For subsidized loans: $4,500 (maximum subsidized limit) x 0.17 = $765 (subsidized prorated annual loan limit).

These examples illustrate how proration is applied to ensure that students in clock-hour programs receive loan amounts that correspond to their actual remaining study time, thereby aligning financial aid with their educational needs.","In clock-hour programs, if a student's remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year, the loan limit must be prorated. This is because the remaining period consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program's defined Title IV academic year. Unlike standard-term programs, the loan period and the remaining period of study in clock-hour programs will always be the same, as the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program or the academic year. Proration is determined by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by a fraction based on the credit or clock hours the student is scheduled to attend. Examples of this proration process include scenarios where a student is enrolled in a remaining period of one quarter, as illustrated in Volume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3.",1.0,1.0,0.4,0.9457163688775488,0.3999999996,,15.43002200126648,multi_query_rag
"How does the NSLDS system assist in managing borrower information and loan limits, particularly in relation to unallocated consolidation loan amounts?","['teacher certification and preparatory coursework and the applicable annual loan limits.)\nHigher Aggregate Loan Limit for Certain Health Professions Students\nAs explained earlier in this chapter, graduate and professional students who are enrolled in certain health professions\nprograms are eligible for higher annual Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits. These students also have a higher combined\nsubsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit.\nThe combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit for graduate and professional health professions students\nwho are eligible to receive the increased annual unsubsidized amounts is $224,000. Not more than $65,500 of this\namount may be from subsidized loans (see the notes following Table 4 above regarding the $65,500 subsidized aggregate\nloan limit for graduate and professional students).\nIf a student who received increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts for a qualifying health profession program later\nenrolls in a non-health professions program, the student is no longer eligible for the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan\nlimits. However, the additional loan amounts received for the health professions program are not counted toward the\nnormal aggregate loan limit for that student.\nChecking Remaining Eligibility Under the Aggregate Loan Limits\nBefore originating a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, it9s important to make sure the student still has\nremaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limits. As long as there is no conflicting information, you may rely on the\nfinancial aid history (provided on the ISIR as well as on the NSLDS Professional Access website) and the Transfer Student\nMonitoring process (for transfer students only) to tell you if a student is about to exceed the applicable aggregate loan\nlimit. (See Volume 1, Chapter 3 for more detail on NSLDS financial aid history, which may also affect eligibility for other\nTitle IV programs.)\nThe Loan History in NSLDS for a borrower who has received Title IV loans shows Aggregate Loan Information for the\nborrower9s outstanding subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding\nPrincipal Balance amounts shown for a borrower in NSLDS do not include unpaid accrued interest, capitalized interest\n(unpaid interest that has been added to the principal balance of the loan), or other charges, as these amounts are not\ncounted against the aggregate loan limits.\nFor each individual loan that a borrower has received, NSLDS shows both the Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) and the\nAggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). The OPB is what the borrower owes, which may include capitalized\ninterest and other charges. The Agg. OPB is the portion of the OPB that counts against the aggregate loan limits for\nsubsidized and unsubsidized loans.\nFor instance, suppose a student has a Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursed in the amount of $5,000. Over time, $200 in\ninterest accrues and is capitalized. Assuming that the borrower has made no payments on the loan, the OPB on the loan\nwill be $5,200 (this is the amount the borrower owes), and the Agg. OPB will be $5,000 (this is the amount that is counted\nagainst the aggregate loan limit). If you are looking at information in NSLDS for individual loans, it is the Agg. OPB that\nyou should use to determine the student9s remaining loan eligibility under the applicable aggregate loan limit.\nThe Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance amounts displayed in NSLDS for a borrower\nalso include the outstanding portion of consolidation loans (both Direct Consolidation Loans and Federal Consolidation\nLoans made under the FFEL program) attributable to Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Subsidized\nFederal Stafford Loans, and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans that were repaid by the consolidation loan.\nUnallocated Consolidation Loan Amounts\nNSLDS may also show a <Consolidation Loans, Unallocated= amount that is not counted against a borrower9s aggregate\nloan limits. The <Consolidation Loans, Unallocated= amount represents the portion of a consolidation loan that cannot be\nattributed to other loans in the borrower9s loan history. For example, it may represent capitalized interest or non-Title IV\nloans that were consolidated. You are not responsible for determining the origin of any unallocated consolidation loan\namounts.\nTreatment of Consolidated Perkins Loans and PLUS Loans\nA consolidated Perkins Loan or PLUS loan becomes part of the unsubsidized portion of a consolidation loan, but it is not', 'Repayment of the Excess Loan Amount\nIf a student who has inadvertently overborrowed wishes to regain Title IV eligibility by repaying the excess loan amount,\nthe student must contact the applicable servicer and comply with the servicer9s repayment instructions. The school may\nassist the student in identifying and contacting the servicer, but the student, not the school, must make the payment of\nthe excess loan funds in accordance with the servicer9s instructions. Once the student has repaid the excess loan amount\nin full, the servicer will send the student confirmation that the excess loan amount has been repaid. The student or\nservicer must provide a copy of the repayment confirmation to the school. The inadvertent overborrowing is considered to\nhave been resolved as of the date the servicer received the borrower9s full payment of the excess loan amount.\nSatisfactory Repayment Arrangements (<Reaffirmation=)\nA student who has inadvertently overborrowed may also regain Title IV eligibility by making satisfactory repayment\narrangements to repay the excess loan amount. This requirement can be met if the student agrees in writing to repay the\nexcess amount according to the terms and conditions of the promissory note that supported the loan. This is called\n<reaffirmation.= The reaffirmation process includes the following five steps:\n1. Either the student or the school where the student is requesting additional Title IV funds contacts the servicer of the\nloan that caused the overborrowing and explains that the student has inadvertently overborrowed and wishes to\nreaffirm the debt.\n2. The servicer sends the student a reaffirmation agreement.\n3. The student reads, signs, and returns the reaffirmation agreement to the servicer.\n4. The servicer sends the student confirmation that the reaffirmation agreement has been accepted. The student or\nservicer must provide a copy of the confirmation to the school where the student is requesting Title IV funds.\n5. The inadvertent overborrowing is considered to have been resolved as of the date the servicer receives the student9s\nsigned reaffirmation agreement.\nConsolidation of Loan Amounts That Exceed the Annual or Aggregate Loan Limit\nIf a borrower who inadvertently received more than the annual or aggregate loan limits has consolidated the loan(s) that\ncaused the borrower to exceed the loan limit into a Direct Consolidation Loan, the Direct Consolidation Loan is considered\na satisfactory arrangement to repay the excess amount. This restores the borrower9s eligibility for Title IV aid. If the school\nwhere the student is seeking aid confirms through NSLDS that the loan(s) have been consolidated, no further action is\nrequired. Note, however, that consolidation of an amount that exceeded the combined aggregate loan limit for Direct\nSubsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans does not automatically make a student eligible for additional Direct Loan\nfunds.\nbefore the student can receive additional Title IV aid.\nRegaining Title IV Eligibility After Inadvertent Overborrowing\n34 CFR 668.35(d)\nDCL GEN-15-20\nDCL GEN-13-02\nDepartment of Education Office of the Inspector General Hotline', ""No Minimum Direct Loan Amount in COD System\nThe COD System does not set a minimum amount for which a school may originate a Direct Loan.\nSequestration\nThe Budget Control Act (BCA) put into place an automatic federal budget cut known as the sequester.

For details, see <Loan Periods= later in this chapter.\nCorrecting Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan Awarding Errors"", 'Chapter 3\nDirect Loan Origination, Loan Periods, and Disbursements\nOrigination Overview\nOrigination is the process of creating a Direct Loan award in the school9s system. Before originating a Direct Loan, a\nschool must determine the student9s or parent9s eligibility for the loan. For each Direct Loan that a school disburses to a\nstudent or parent, the school must submit a loan award record to the COD System that includes the student9s grade level,\nthe loan period and academic year dates, the loan amount, the anticipated and actual dates and amounts of the loan\ndisbursements, and other information. Submission of a loan award record serves as the school9s certification that it has\ndetermined the borrower9s eligibility for the loan.\nThe specific Direct Loan amount that a student or parent borrower is eligible to receive is determined based on various\nfactors such as the student9s COA, Student Aid Index (SAI), OFA, and remaining eligibility under the annual and aggregate\nloan limits (see Chapter 4 for guidance on annual and aggregate loan limits). Some of these factors are relevant only\nwhen determining eligibility for certain types of Direct Loans. When originating a Direct Loan, the COA used in\ndetermining the loan amount may include only those costs associated with the period of enrollment (loan period) for\nwhich the loan is being originated.\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans have annual and aggregate limits that are the same for all\nstudents at a given grade level and dependency status. You may not originate a Direct Loan for an amount that:\nExceeds the amount requested by the borrower;\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus the student9s SAI and OFA;\nIn the case of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan or Direct PLUS Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus OFA; or\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, would cause the student to exceed the annual or\naggregate limit.\nSee Volume 3, Chapter 3 for more information on packaging Direct Loans as part of a student9s financial aid award.\nOriginating a Loan\nIt9s important to remember that your school, not the Department, is responsible for determining a borrower9s eligibility for\na Direct Loan. Schools that originate and disburse loans to ineligible borrowers, or for loan amounts that exceed loan\nlimits or financial need, are subject to administrative actions such as a fine, limitation, suspension, and termination, as\nwell as liabilities including repayment to the government of interest and costs it has paid on the ineligible loans.\nYou must originate a Direct Loan while the student is enrolled and eligible for the period of enrollment for which the loan\nis intended. You may not originate a loan for a period in which the student is no longer enrolled. For example, you may\nnot originate a loan for a prior academic year that has ended, even if the student is enrolled and eligible for the current\nacademic year. Similarly, if a student who was enrolled at least half time only for the fall and spring quarters of an\nacademic year consisting of fall, winter, and spring quarters does not request a loan until the spring, you may not at that\ntime originate a loan for the previous fall quarter.\nFor all Direct Loans, you must document the student9s COA, SAI, and OFA in the student9s file. This information must be\nmade available to the Department upon request.\nYou must confirm that the borrower meets the definition of eligible borrower by doing the following:\nDetermine that the student is enrolled at least half time and making satisfactory academic progress (see Volume 1);\nReview the NSLDS information on the ISIR or the NSLDS Professional Access website to ensure that the student is not\nin default, does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant or loan (see Volume 1), and will not exceed the annual or\naggregate loan limits (as described in Chapter 4 of this volume);\nEnsure that the amount of the loan, in combination with other aid, will not exceed the student9s financial need or', ""Graduate program in Public Health (including Master's and Doctoral\ndegree programs in Public Health)\nCouncil on Education for Public Health\nDoctor of Chiropractic\nCouncil on Chiropractic Education, Commission\non Accreditation\nDoctoral Degree in Clinical Psychology\nAmerican Psychological Association,\nCommittee on Accreditation\nMaster's or Doctoral Degree in Health Administration\nCommission on Accreditation of Healthcare\nManagement Education\nThe increased unsubsidized amounts that an eligible health professions student may receive are in addition to the regular\n$20,500 Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual loan limit for graduate and professional students. For example, a student\nenrolled in a nine-month Doctor of Dentistry program is eligible for the regular Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual maximum\nfor a graduate or professional student ($20,500), plus the maximum increased unsubsidized amount of $20,000, for a\ntotal Direct Unsubsidized Loan maximum of $40,500 per academic year.\nGraduate and professional students who qualify for the higher annual Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits are also eligible for\na higher combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit, as explained later in this chapter.\nProration of the Increased Health Professions Annual Loan Limit for an Academic Year Covering 10 or 11 Months\nTables 3A and 3B above show the increased unsubsidized loan limits for programs with an academic year of either nine\nmonths or 12 months.

If the academic year covers 10 or 11 months, the prorated\nannual loan limit is determined by dividing the applicable loan limit for an academic year covering nine months by nine,\nand then multiplying the result by 10 or 11. For example, the prorated increased unsubsidized loan limit for a Doctor of\nDentistry program with an 11-month academic year would be $24,444, calculated as follows:\n$20,000 ÷ 9 = $2,222.22\n$2,222.22 x 11 = $24,444.42, rounded to $24,444\nForeign Schools May Not Award Increased Unsubsidized Loan Amounts\nForeign schools that participate in the Direct Loan Program may not award the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan\namounts to health professions students.\nAggregate Loan Limit Overview\nAs explained earlier in this chapter, there are limits on the maximum Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan\namounts that a student may receive each academic year (annual loan limits). There are also limits on a student9s\nmaximum outstanding total Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan debt. These are called aggregate loan\nlimits. A borrower who has reached the aggregate borrowing limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized\nLoans may not receive additional loans.

Treatment of Consolidated Perkins Loans and PLUS Loans A consolidated Perkins Loan or PLUS loan becomes part of the unsubsidized portion of a consolidation loan, but it is not']","The National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) plays a crucial role in managing borrower information and loan limits, particularly concerning unallocated consolidation loan amounts. Here’s how it assists in these areas:

1. **Aggregate Loan Information**: NSLDS provides a comprehensive overview of a borrower's outstanding subsidized and unsubsidized loans, including the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). This balance reflects the portion of the borrower's loans that counts against their aggregate loan limits, excluding unpaid accrued interest and other charges.

2. **Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) vs. Aggregate OPB**: For each loan, NSLDS displays both the OPB (the total amount owed, including capitalized interest) and the Agg. OPB (the amount that counts against the aggregate limits). This distinction is essential for schools and borrowers to determine remaining eligibility under the applicable loan limits.

3. **Unallocated Consolidation Loan Amounts**: NSLDS may show an ""Unallocated"" amount for consolidation loans, which represents portions of a consolidation loan that cannot be attributed to specific loans in the borrower's history. This could include capitalized interest or non-Title IV loans that were consolidated. Importantly, these unallocated amounts do not count against the borrower's aggregate loan limits, allowing borrowers to maintain eligibility for additional loans.

4. **Monitoring Borrower Eligibility**: Schools can rely on NSLDS to check a borrower's financial aid history and ensure they do not exceed the aggregate loan limits before originating new loans. This is particularly important for managing the eligibility of borrowers who may have received increased loan amounts for specific programs, such as health professions.

5. **Restoration of Eligibility**: If a borrower inadvertently exceeds loan limits and consolidates their loans, NSLDS confirms the consolidation, which can restore the borrower's eligibility for Title IV aid. This process is facilitated by the information available in NSLDS, ensuring that schools can accurately assess a borrower's status.

In summary, NSLDS assists in managing borrower information and loan limits by providing detailed loan histories, distinguishing between amounts that count against limits and those that do not, and facilitating the monitoring of borrower eligibility for federal student aid.","The NSLDS system assists in managing borrower information by providing loan holders with the necessary data during the exit counseling process, as part of the Department's online counseling services.

There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default. Your school can also offer financial literacy classes, on a credit or non-credit basis, that include\ninformation on budgeting, debt management, anticipated earnings by profession, elements of loan counseling, etc.,\nthough eligibility for a Direct Loan cannot be contingent on completion of such a class.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrowers\nBelow we provide a summary of the information that must be covered in entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan\nand Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers. For more detailed information, refer to the regulations cited at the end of this\nsection.\nEntrance counseling for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loan borrowers must:\nExplain the use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN);\nEmphasize the importance of the loan repayment obligation;\nDescribe the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, delinquent debt collection procedures\nunder Federal law, and litigation;\nEmphasize that the borrower must repay the full amount of the loan even if the borrower does not complete the\nprogram, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain\nemployment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services\nthat the student paid for with the loan;\nInform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on a range of student levels of\nindebtedness depending on the types of loans the borrower has received, or based on the average indebtedness of\nother borrowers in the same program at the same school;\nExplain how accepting the loan will affect the borrower9s eligibility for other forms of student financial assistance;\nProvide information on how interest accrues and is capitalized during periods when the interest is not paid by either\nthe borrower or the Department;\nInform the borrower of the option to pay the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan while the borrower is in school;\nExplain the definition of half-time enrollment at the school and the consequences of not maintaining half-time\nenrollment;\nExplain the importance of contacting the appropriate offices at the school if the borrower withdraws before\nDirect Loan Entrance Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(a)\nLoan Counseling Requirements and Flexibilities\nDCL GEN-15-06']","[""<1-hop>\n\nprovided by those companies are already offered free of charge through the Department or the borrower's loan servicer; Provide a general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers (i.e. student loan interest deduction); and Require the borrower to provide current information concerning their name, address, Social Security number, references, and driver9s license number and state of issuance, as well as the borrower9s expected permanent address, the address of their next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower9s expected employer, if known (see also < Providing Borrower Information at Separation= below). As stated above, Direct Loan exit counseling must provide borrowers with the information the Department makes available in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA. This section of the law requires the Department to make available to postsecondary schools and other entities a wide variety of information about federal student assistance programs, including information to help students assess the debt burden and repayment obligations that will be incurred as a result of receiving Title IV loans. As noted below under < Counseling Methods,= documentation that a borrower has completed the Department9s online exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan exit counseling requirements. Schools that choose to conduct their own exit counseling can meet the requirement to provide borrowers with the information made available by the Department in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA by providing borrowers with a copy of the Department9s Direct Loan Exit Counseling Guide. Providing Borrower Information at Separation Schools that conduct their own exit counseling must provide the current personal information collected from the student (name, address, references, etc.) to students9 loan servicers within 60 days. Students authorize their school to release information to servicers in the loan promissory note they signed. No further permission is needed. Students who complete online exit counseling on the Department9s StudentAid.gov website fulfill this requirement as part of the counseling session; NSLDS provides the information to the loan holders. Counseling Methods The Department offers Direct Loan Program online entrance and exit counseling for students on the StudentAid.gov website. Your school will receive notification through the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) (see <Required Electronic Processes= in Volume 2, Chapter 3 for more information) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers, and completion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If your school documents that borrowers have completed the Department9s online counseling, it has satisfied its counseling responsibility.

For more information, see the regulation cited below."", ""<2-hop>\n\nIf you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower has received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of their financial need, and the student is still enrolled for the loan period, you must return the subsidized loan amount for which the student was ineligible and ask the student if they wish to replace the subsidized funds with a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. If the student agrees to accept the unsubsidized loan funds and they also received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the same loan period as the Direct Subsidized Loan, you may increase the amount of the Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursements by the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. If the student did not receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you may originate a new Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. The new Direct Unsubsidized Loan must have the same loan period and disbursement dates as the Direct Subsidized Loan. If the student does not agree to have the excess subsidized loan funds replaced by a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must still return the ineligible Direct Subsidized Loan amount. If you discover that a student received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of financial need after the student is no longer enrolled for the loan period, you are not required to take any action to eliminate the excess subsidized loan amount. If you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower who was eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan instead received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must correct the error (even if the loan period has ended) by submitting a downward adjustment to reduce or eliminate the Direct Unsubsidized Loan, as appropriate, and replacing it with the same amount of Direct Subsidized Loan funds. You may do this either by adjusting an existing Direct Subsidized Loan upwards, or, if the student does not have an existing Direct Subsidized Loan, by originating a new Direct Subsidized Loan. Replacing a Direct Unsubsidized Loan with a Direct Subsidized Loan in this circumstance does not require obtaining the student9s consent. Direct Loan Overawards As explained in Volume 4, Chapter 3, an overaward exists when a student9s aid package exceeds their need or overall COA. If you discover that a student who received Direct Loans has been overawarded and your school has already received and disbursed some or all of the Direct Loan funds, you have the following options: If the student9s aid package includes a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, or a nonfederal education loan, and the aid package doesn9t already apply these loans toward the student9s SAI, you may choose to adjust the aid package to have all or a portion of these loans replace the SAI, thus reducing or eliminating the overaward (for more detail and examples, see <Substituting for the SAI= in Volume 3, Chapter 3). If you have not yet made the second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan, you can reduce or cancel the second or subsequent disbursement. If the overaward situation occurs after the full amount of a Direct Loan has been disbursed, you do not need to adjust the amount of the loan. However, you might have to adjust the aid package to prevent an overaward of Campus-Based funds or to prevent the total aid package from exceeding the student9s need. Although a school isn9t required to return Direct Loan funds that were disbursed to the borrower (either directly or by applying them to the student's account) before the overaward situation occurred, the law doesn9t prevent your school from returning funds that were applied to the student account if you choose to do so. A borrower who receives a direct payment of loan funds is not required to repay an overawarded amount, unless the overaward was caused by the borrower9s misreporting or withholding of information.""]","The Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) facilitates compliance with Direct Loan exit counseling requirements by providing schools with notifications when borrowers complete their exit counseling online through the Department's StudentAid.gov website. This documentation confirms that the school has fulfilled its responsibility to ensure that students receive the necessary counseling before they graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time enrollment. If a school documents that a borrower has completed the Department's online exit counseling, it satisfies all Direct Loan exit counseling requirements.

In the case of a student receiving excess Direct Subsidized Loan funds, the context does not provide specific actions to take. However, it is generally advisable for students to contact their loan servicer or the financial aid office at their school to discuss the situation and determine the appropriate steps to rectify the excess funding. This may involve returning the excess funds or adjusting future disbursements.","The Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) facilitates compliance with Direct Loan exit counseling requirements by notifying schools of online loan counseling completed by borrowers. This ensures that schools are aware of students fulfilling their counseling responsibilities, as completion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If a student receives excess Direct Subsidized Loan funds, the school must return the ineligible amount if the student is still enrolled. The student can choose to replace the excess subsidized funds with a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. If the student agrees, the school may increase the Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursements or originate a new one for the same loan period. If the student does not agree, the excess subsidized loan amount must still be returned.",0.3333333333333333,0.5,0.38,0.0,0.4285714279591837,0.4,10.060267210006714,multi_query_rag
How does the FSA Handbook guide schools in handling loan adjustments for clinical work and the death of a Title IV aid recipient?,"['may not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of\npayments while the student was enrolled at least half time.\nIf a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death,\nthe school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of\nthe original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent\nstudent (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4\nof this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate\na Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended.\nFor additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the\nFSA Handbook.\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term\nVolume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and\nnonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine\nweeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education\nprogram work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical\nWork in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below.\nIf clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard\nterm, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.\nIf a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the\nstarting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of\nthe clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on\nAugust 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not\nbegin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be\nthe beginning date of the term.\nIf the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a\nDirect Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the\ncase).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the\nspring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as\nSeptember 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which\nit is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term.\nIf loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the\nnormal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies,\nand the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of\na fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that\nfall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1\nthrough June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1\nthrough June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for\ninformation on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits).\nIf there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work,\nand the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to\nbegin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two\nloan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.', 'Regardless of the counseling methods your school uses, it must document that the student received entrance and exit\ncounseling, and it must ensure that an individual with expertise in the Title IV programs is reasonably available shortly\nafter the counseling to answer the student9s questions.\nCounseling for Correspondence and Study Abroad Students\nIf a first-time student borrower has enrolled in a study-abroad program (approved by a U.S. school for credit) or a\ncorrespondence or distance learning program, the school must document that the student has completed online entrance\ncounseling that meets the regulatory Direct Loan entrance counseling requirements or provide written entrance\ncounseling information by mail or email before making the first disbursement of a Direct Loan to the student.\nIn the case of exit counseling for correspondence programs or study abroad programs, the school may mail or email the\nborrower written counseling materials within 30 days after the borrower completes the program, with a request that they\nprovide the contact and personal information that would ordinarily have been collected through the counseling process.\nProviding Additional Information\nYour school can take additional steps to counsel students, such as assisting them with developing a budget, estimating\nneed for loans, and planning for repayment.

The preparatory courses must be offered as part of an eligible program offered by\nthe school, though the student does not have to be enrolled in that program. A school may not award Direct Loans for\nstandalone courses that do not count towards an eligible program and exist solely to serve as preparatory coursework.\nA student who is enrolled at least half time in preparatory coursework as described above is eligible to receive loans for a\nmaximum of one consecutive 12-month period (not per program) beginning on the first day of the loan period. If the\nconsecutive 12-month period of preparatory coursework spans more than one academic year, the student may receive\nmore than one annual loan limit.\nTo be eligible for loans under this exception, the student must be taking classes that are a prerequisite for admission.

For more detailed information, refer to\nthe regulations cited at the end of the section.\nRequired Exit Counseling Content\nExit counseling must:\nInform the student borrower of the average anticipated monthly repayment amount based on the student borrower9s\nindebtedness or on the average indebtedness of student borrowers who have received Direct Loans for attendance\nat the same school or in the same program of study at the same school;\nReview all available Direct Loan repayment plan options, including a description of the different features of each plan\nand sample information showing the average anticipated monthly payments, and the difference in interest paid and\ntotal payments under each plan;\nExplain the options to prepay each loan, to pay each loan on a shorter schedule, and to change repayment plans;\nProvide information on the effects of loan consolidation;\nInclude debt management strategies that are designed to facilitate repayment;\nExplain to the borrower how to contact their loan servicer;\nExplain the use of an MPN;\nEmphasize the importance of the loan repayment obligation;\nEmphasize that the borrower must repay the full amount of the loan even if the borrower does not complete the\nprogram, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain\nemployment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services\nthat the student paid for with the loan;\nDescribe the likely consequences of default;\nProvide a general description of the terms and conditions under which a borrower may obtain full or partial\nforgiveness or discharge of a loan, defer repayment of a loan, or be granted forbearance on a loan;\nProvide a copy, either in print or by electronic means, of the information the Department makes available in\naccordance with section 485(d) of the HEA (see below);\nReview information on the availability of the Department9s Student Loan Ombudsman9s office;\nInform the borrower of the availability of Title IV loan information in NSLDS and how NSLDS can be used to obtain\nTitle IV loan status information;\nInform the borrower that (1) they may be contacted during the repayment period by third-party student debt relief\ncompanies; (2) the borrower should use caution when dealing with those companies; and (3) the services typically', ""Regardless of the length of the loan period, you may disburse a Direct Loan in a single installment if the loan is to cover a\nstudent's COA in a study abroad program and your school9s calculated cohort default rate is less than 5% for the most\nrecent fiscal year for which data are available.\nDirect Loan Disbursements for Completed Payment Periods\nThe Direct Loan Program regulations allow a school to include in a single disbursement the disbursements for any\npayment periods that have ended. However, the COD System (except for schools exempted because of low default rates)\nrequires schools to enter at least two anticipated disbursement dates. Therefore, when creating a loan origination record\nfor a Direct Loan when you intend to include in a disbursement loan proceeds for any payment periods that have been\ncompleted, you should enter the actual date you anticipate making the disbursement as the anticipated date for all\ndisbursements that would be included. For example, consider a school attempting to submit an origination when the data\nis as follows:\nLoan period: 09/01 - 05/30 (fall through spring)\nMinimum number of disbursements normally required: 2\nPayment period 1: 09/01 - 12/20\nPayment period 2: 01/06 - 05/30\nDate school creates origination record: 01/09\nIf you anticipate disbursing the loan proceeds for both payment periods on January 16, you should enter January 16 as the\ndate for both the first and second disbursements when you create the origination record.\nDirect Loan Disbursements Made After the Date of the Borrower9s Death\nIf a school learns that a student or parent Direct Loan borrower has died before one or more disbursements of a loan have\nbeen made, the school must cancel all pending disbursements. Direct Loan funds cannot be disbursed when there is no\npossibility of repayment. In addition, if a school is not informed of a student or parent borrower9s death until after one or\nmore loan disbursements have been made, the school must return to the Department the full amount of all loan funds\nthat were credited to the student9s school account after the date of the borrower9s death (if the post-death disbursement\ncreated a credit balance that was paid directly to the student or parent, the school is not responsible for returning the\ncredit balance amount).\nDisbursements after the date of the borrower9s death are most likely to occur when a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower\ndies. If an enrolled student dies, the school will generally learn of the death in a timely manner and can cancel any\npending loan disbursements. However, if a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower dies, the student or other family members\nStudy Abroad Program Exception\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(6)(i)(B)\nDirect Loan Disbursement After One or More Payment Periods Have Elapsed\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(4)(i)"", ""provided by those companies are already offered free of charge through the Department or the borrower's loan\nservicer;\nProvide a general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers (i.e. student loan\ninterest deduction); and\nRequire the borrower to provide current information concerning their name, address, Social Security number,\nreferences, and driver9s license number and state of issuance, as well as the borrower9s expected permanent\naddress, the address of their next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower9s expected employer, if known\n(see also <Providing Borrower Information at Separation= below).\nAs stated above, Direct Loan exit counseling must provide borrowers with the information the Department makes\navailable in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA. This section of the law requires the Department to make available\nto postsecondary schools and other entities a wide variety of information about federal student assistance programs,\nincluding information to help students assess the debt burden and repayment obligations that will be incurred as a result\nof receiving Title IV loans. As noted below under <Counseling Methods,= documentation that a borrower has completed the\nDepartment9s online exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan exit counseling requirements. Schools that choose to\nconduct their own exit counseling can meet the requirement to provide borrowers with the information made available by\nthe Department in accordance with section 485(d) of the HEA by providing borrowers with a copy of the Department9s\nDirect Loan Exit Counseling Guide.\nProviding Borrower Information at Separation\nSchools that conduct their own exit counseling must provide the current personal information collected from the student\n(name, address, references, etc.) to students9 loan servicers within 60 days. Students authorize their school to release\ninformation to servicers in the loan promissory note they signed. No further permission is needed.\nStudents who complete online exit counseling on the Department9s StudentAid.gov website fulfill this requirement as part\nof the counseling session; NSLDS provides the information to the loan holders.\nCounseling Methods\nThe Department offers Direct Loan Program online entrance and exit counseling for students on the StudentAid.gov\nwebsite. Your school will receive notification through the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) (see <Required Electronic\nProcesses= in Volume 2, Chapter 3 for more information) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers, and\ncompletion information can also be viewed on the COD System website. If your school documents that borrowers have\ncompleted the Department9s online counseling, it has satisfied its counseling responsibility. Documentation that a\nborrower has completed the Department9s online entrance or exit counseling fully satisfies all Direct Loan entrance or exit\ncounseling requirements.\nYour school may also choose to provide entrance or exit counseling through an in-person session or (for entrance\ncounseling) by providing a separate written form to the student that the student signs and returns to the school. If your\nschool conducts in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions\ncan help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive\nprograms to ensure that students understand the terms and conditions of their loans. Counseling materials, such as the\nentrance and exit counseling guides, are available in the Financial Aid Toolkit.\nA school may adopt an alternative approach for entrance counseling as a part of its quality assurance plan. For more\ninformation, see the regulation cited below.\nRequired Content for Exit Counseling\n34 CFR 685.304(b)(4)"", 'Repayment of the Excess Loan Amount\nIf a student who has inadvertently overborrowed wishes to regain Title IV eligibility by repaying the excess loan amount,\nthe student must contact the applicable servicer and comply with the servicer9s repayment instructions. The school may\nassist the student in identifying and contacting the servicer, but the student, not the school, must make the payment of\nthe excess loan funds in accordance with the servicer9s instructions. Once the student has repaid the excess loan amount\nin full, the servicer will send the student confirmation that the excess loan amount has been repaid. The student or\nservicer must provide a copy of the repayment confirmation to the school. The inadvertent overborrowing is considered to\nhave been resolved as of the date the servicer received the borrower9s full payment of the excess loan amount.\nSatisfactory Repayment Arrangements (<Reaffirmation=)\nA student who has inadvertently overborrowed may also regain Title IV eligibility by making satisfactory repayment\narrangements to repay the excess loan amount. This requirement can be met if the student agrees in writing to repay the\nexcess amount according to the terms and conditions of the promissory note that supported the loan. This is called\n<reaffirmation.= The reaffirmation process includes the following five steps:\n1. Either the student or the school where the student is requesting additional Title IV funds contacts the servicer of the\nloan that caused the overborrowing and explains that the student has inadvertently overborrowed and wishes to\nreaffirm the debt.\n2. The servicer sends the student a reaffirmation agreement.\n3. The student reads, signs, and returns the reaffirmation agreement to the servicer.\n4. The servicer sends the student confirmation that the reaffirmation agreement has been accepted. The student or\nservicer must provide a copy of the confirmation to the school where the student is requesting Title IV funds.\n5. The inadvertent overborrowing is considered to have been resolved as of the date the servicer receives the student9s\nsigned reaffirmation agreement.\nConsolidation of Loan Amounts That Exceed the Annual or Aggregate Loan Limit\nIf a borrower who inadvertently received more than the annual or aggregate loan limits has consolidated the loan(s) that\ncaused the borrower to exceed the loan limit into a Direct Consolidation Loan, the Direct Consolidation Loan is considered\na satisfactory arrangement to repay the excess amount. This restores the borrower9s eligibility for Title IV aid. If the school\nwhere the student is seeking aid confirms through NSLDS that the loan(s) have been consolidated, no further action is\nrequired. Note, however, that consolidation of an amount that exceeded the combined aggregate loan limit for Direct\nSubsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans does not automatically make a student eligible for additional Direct Loan\nfunds.\nbefore the student can receive additional Title IV aid.\nRegaining Title IV Eligibility After Inadvertent Overborrowing\n34 CFR 668.35(d)\nDCL GEN-15-20\nDCL GEN-13-02\nDepartment of Education Office of the Inspector General Hotline']","['<1-hop>\n\nmay not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of payments while the student was enrolled at least half time. If a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death, the school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent student (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4 of this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.', '<2-hop>\n\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and nonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","The FSA Handbook provides specific guidance for schools on how to handle loan adjustments in two key situations: when a Title IV aid recipient dies and when clinical work is included in a standard term.

1. **Handling Loan Adjustments for the Death of a Title IV Aid Recipient**:
   - If a school learns that a student or parent Direct Loan borrower has died before any disbursements have been made, the school must cancel all pending disbursements. Direct Loan funds cannot be disbursed when there is no possibility of repayment.
   - If disbursements have already been made after the date of the borrower's death, the school must return the full amount of those funds to the Department of Education. However, if the disbursement created a credit balance that was paid directly to the student or parent, the school is not responsible for returning that amount.
   - In cases where a parent borrower has died, the school should check if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended.

2. **Loan Adjustments for Clinical Work**:
   - The FSA Handbook outlines that if clinical work meets specific criteria to be included in a standard term or substantially equal nonstandard term, the school must adjust the loan period dates accordingly. For instance, if clinical work begins before the term starts, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work.
   - Conversely, if the clinical work ends after the term's ending date, the loan period end date is adjusted to the end date of the clinical work.
   - Schools must also ensure that the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies is adjusted to reflect these changes in loan period dates.

These guidelines ensure that schools manage loan disbursements responsibly and in compliance with federal regulations, particularly in sensitive situations like the death of a borrower or the inclusion of clinical work in academic terms.","The FSA Handbook provides guidance for schools on handling loan adjustments in two specific scenarios. Firstly, when a Title IV aid recipient dies, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original loan that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended. This is detailed in Appendix B of the FSA Handbook. Secondly, for clinical work included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the FSA Handbook allows for exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules. If clinical work begins before or ends after the normal term dates, the loan period start and end dates must be adjusted accordingly. This ensures that the academic year period and payment period dates align with the clinical work schedule, as explained in Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook.",1.0,1.0,0.77,0.9365998648966887,0.49999999949999996,,15.592590093612671,multi_query_rag

There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'If your school participates in the Direct PLUS program but a student9s parent cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the\nstudent is allowed to borrow additional unsubsidized funds (see <Criteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan Funds= in Chapter 4 of this volume).\nRequired Counseling for Direct PLUS Loan Applicants With Adverse Credit\nAny student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who has an adverse credit history but qualifies by obtaining an endorser\nor documenting that there are extenuating circumstances must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling on the\nDepartment9s StudentAid.gov website.\nAdverse Credit History and Default\nAlthough a default on a Title IV loan will generally appear in a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant9s credit record\nand result in the individual being determined to have an adverse credit history, being in default on a Title IV loan and\nhaving an adverse credit history are separate eligibility issues. A Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified through the\nDepartment9s National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as being in default on a Title IV loan and who has also been\ndetermined to have an adverse credit history (due to the default and/or other adverse credit conditions) cannot qualify for\na Direct PLUS Loan simply by obtaining an endorser or by providing acceptable documentation of extenuating\ncircumstances. The applicant must also separately resolve the default status by one of the means discussed under\n<Resolving Default Status= in Volume 1, Chapter 3.\nIn some cases, the Direct PLUS Loan credit check may not reveal a default on a Title IV loan, particularly if the default is\nnot recent. If a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified in NSLDS as being in default on a Title IV\nloan does not have any other adverse credit issues, the applicant will pass the PLUS credit check. In this circumstance you\ncannot assume that the approved credit check result supersedes the information in NSLDS. The default must be resolved\nbefore you can disburse Direct PLUS Loan funds or other Title IV aid to the applicant.\nDirect PLUS Loan Application\nSchools that offer Direct PLUS Loans have the option of requiring student and parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants to\ncomplete the Direct PLUS Loan Application (formally known as the ""Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request for Supplemental\nInformation"") on the Department\'s StudentAid.gov website as the first step in applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. The Direct\nPLUS Loan Application collects the requested loan amount, the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended, and\nother information related to processing the requested Direct PLUS Loan.\nUse of the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov is not required. Schools may choose to develop their own\nprocesses for obtaining the information needed to originate Direct PLUS Loans.\nAlthough the Department9s FAFSA Processing System (FPS) matches student Direct PLUS Loan applicants against NSLDS\nto determine if they are in default on a Title IV loan, it does not perform this match for parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants.\nHowever, the Department conducts an NSLDS default check on all Direct PLUS Loan applicants (both students and\nparents) who complete the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov.\nSchools that use the Direct PLUS Loan Application are notified of the result of the NSLDS default check through the\nCommon Origination and Disbursement (COD) System.

For example, if a student9s biological or legal adoptive parents are divorced, they may decide to each take out a\nDirect PLUS Loan for an agreed upon amount (not to exceed the student9s COA, minus other financial assistance (OFA)) to\nhelp pay for the cost of the student9s education.\nRequirement for Dependent Students To File a FAFSA Form\nIn all cases, the dependent student on whose behalf a parent has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan must have filed a FAFSA\nform and received an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or FAFSA Submission Summary (see Chapter 1 of the\nApplication and Verification Guide for information on the ISIR and FAFSA Submission Summary). This requirement ensures\nthat student eligibility data matches are conducted to verify that the dependent student on whose behalf the parent is\nborrowing:\nIs not in default on a Title IV loan and does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant;\nHas had their Social Security number verified by the Social Security Administration; and\nHas had their citizenship status confirmed by either the Social Security Administration or the Department of\nHomeland Security.\nNote that this requirement is for the student to submit a FAFSA form. It is not a requirement for the parent borrower to\nsubmit a FAFSA form in the parent9s name, and it does not preclude an otherwise eligible parent whose information is not\nincluded on the FAFSA form (sometimes referred to as a <non-custodial= parent) from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan.\nBefore originating a Direct PLUS Loan for a parent borrower, schools must review the ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary\nof the dependent student to ensure there are no student eligibility issues that must be resolved before the parent can\nreceive the Direct PLUS Loan.\nAdverse Credit History\nAn individual with an adverse credit history is prohibited from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan unless they meet additional\neligibility requirements. The Department obtains a credit report on each student or parent applicant for a Direct PLUS\nLoan. An applicant is considered to have an adverse credit history if:\nThey have one or more debts with a total combined outstanding balance greater than $2,085 that (1) are 90 or more\ndays delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or (2) have been placed in collection or charged-off during the two\nyears preceding the date of the credit report; or\nDuring the five years preceding the date of the credit report, the applicant has been determined to be in default on a\ndebt; has had debts discharged in bankruptcy; or has been the subject of foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage\ngarnishment, or write-off of a Title IV debt.\nFor Direct PLUS Loan eligibility purposes, <charged-off= means a debt that has been written off as a loss, but that is still\nsubject to collection action. <In collection= means a debt that has been placed with a collection agency by a creditor or\nthat is subject to more intensive efforts by a creditor to recover amounts owed from a borrower who has not responded\nsatisfactorily to the routine demands of the creditor9s billing procedures.\nAn applicant cannot be denied a Direct PLUS Loan because they have no credit history. That is, the absence of a credit\nhistory is not considered to be adverse credit.\nThere are two means by which a Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit history can still qualify for a Direct\nPLUS Loan. One option is for the applicant to obtain an endorser who doesn9t have an adverse credit history. An endorser\nis someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower doesn9t repay it. For a parent borrower, the\nendorser may not be the dependent student for whom the parent is borrowing.\nAs an alternative to obtaining an endorser, an applicant who has been determined to have an adverse credit history may\nalso qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan by submitting documentation to the Department showing that there are extenuating\ncircumstances associated with the adverse credit. The Department has the final decision on determining whether\nextenuating circumstances exist.\nA borrower who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting to the satisfaction of the\nDepartment that extenuating circumstances exist must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling, as discussed below.', 'First Year\n$9,500\n$3,500\nSecond Year\n$10,500\n$4,500\nThird Year and Beyond\n$12,500\n$5,500\nCriteria for Dependent Students to Receive Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Funds\nDependent students whose parents are unable to borrow Direct PLUS Loans due to adverse credit or other exceptional\ncircumstances may receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds up to the same amount that is available to\nindependent undergraduate students. Because Direct PLUS Loans can be made for up to the full COA minus other financial\nassistance received, the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount may not be sufficient to substitute entirely for the\namount a parent could receive under the Direct PLUS Loan program. Therefore, you should determine whether the\nparents may be able to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser who does not have an adverse credit history\nbefore originating additional unsubsidized loan amounts for the dependent student. Before a dependent student can\nreceive the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount, you must document the basis of the student9s eligibility. Some\nbasic guidelines for making this determination are discussed below. However, keep in mind that none of the following, by\nthemselves, are sufficient to make a dependent student eligible for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds:\nThe parent9s unwillingness to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan (even though the parent would otherwise be eligible to\nborrow);\nThe school9s decision not to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan program; or\nThe financial aid administrator9s belief that the parent should not borrow a Direct PLUS Loan.\nGeneral Guidelines for Determining That a Dependent Student May Receive Additional Unsubsidized Funds\nThe sections that follow provide general guidelines for making a determination that a dependent student is eligible to\nreceive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds under various circumstances.\nOnly One Parent Has Applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and Been Denied\nIf only one of a student9s parents has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and been denied based on adverse credit, you may\naward additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds on that basis, without first determining whether there is another parent\nwho could take out a Direct PLUS Loan. However, if both parents apply independently and one is approved and the other\ndenied, the dependent student is not eligible for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts.\nA Previously Approved Parent Later Requests Additional Direct PLUS Loan Funds and Is Denied\nThe dependent student may become eligible at any time during an academic year if a parent has first been approved and\nthen later denied a Direct PLUS Loan. For example, if a parent was approved for and received the full amount of a Direct\nPLUS Loan for a fall-spring loan period, but the parent is subsequently determined ineligible due to having an adverse\ncredit history when they request additional Direct PLUS Loan funds later during the spring semester, you may award\nIncreased Direct Unsubsidized Loan Eligibility for Independent Undergraduates and Certain\nDependent Undergraduates\n34 CFR 685.203(c)', 'information, see the discussion under <Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans= in DCL GEN-11-07.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form\nIf you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information\nsections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the\nstudent, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up\nto the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent\nsecond-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume\nfor information on annual loan limits).

A parent\nwho had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements\noutlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal\ngovernment holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s\nineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student\nis otherwise eligible.\nRequirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers\nSchools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan\nProgram and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available\nto both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students.

One such situation is when a dependent undergraduate qualifies for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, but in a subsequent academic year the student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan. In this circumstance the dependent student no longer qualifies for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. During any academic year when a dependent student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student is subject to the dependent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student otherwise would have been eligible to receive under the dependent undergraduate annual loan limits are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the $31,000 combined subsidized and unsubsidized dependent undergraduate aggregate limit (see Example 3 below). A similar situation occurs when a student who received loans for a graduate or professional degree program later returns to school and enrolls in an undergraduate program. The student is then subject to the undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student previously received as an undergraduate are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the undergraduate aggregate loan limit (see Example 2 earlier in this chapter). Volume 8, Chapter 4, Example 3: Aggregate Loan Limits and Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Amounts When Parents Are Unable To Obtain Direct PLUS Loans A dependent student receives additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the additional amounts available to independent undergraduates) for the first three years of a four-year program because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan for each of those years. For each of the first three years, the student receives the maximum subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts under the independent student annual loan limits (remember that the annual subsidized maximums are the same for dependent and independent undergraduates): First Year (independent student loan limit) $3,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Second Year (independent student loan limit) $4,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Third Year (independent student loan limit) $5,500 subsidized $7,000 unsubsidized ($5,000 more than dependent maximum) Total $13,500 subsidized $19,000 unsubsidized ($13,000 more than dependent maximum) In the fourth year, the parent is eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, so the student is then subject to the annual and aggregate loan limits for a dependent undergraduate. The dependent student received a total of $13,500 in Direct Subsidized Loan funds and $19,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds ($32,500 combined subsidized and unsubsidized total) for the first three years when the student9s parent was unable to obtain Direct PLUS Loans. These are the same amounts that an independent student who qualified for the maximum annual loan limit each year could have received.

Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers. For this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student who requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before the authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan to a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling. Entrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are about to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person counseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. If entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable steps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the terms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the borrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic document. Your school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance education, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed. You may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance counseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements are reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that unreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling can include one or more of the following: Extra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods; A requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though you cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan); A requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or A requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.']","If a student's parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student's eligibility for a Direct Unsubsidized Loan is affected. Specifically, if a parent is approved for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student is not eligible to receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds. However, if the parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan due to adverse credit or other exceptional circumstances, the student may be allowed to borrow additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds, up to the same amount available to independent undergraduate students.

Entrance counseling plays a crucial role in this process. It is required for all first-time student borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and student Direct PLUS Loans. This counseling provides comprehensive information about the terms and conditions of the loans, the borrower's responsibilities, and the implications of borrowing. For instance, it emphasizes the importance of repayment and the consequences of default. Schools must ensure that students complete this counseling before the first disbursement of their loans, which helps them understand their financial obligations and the impact of their borrowing decisions.

In summary, while a parent's eligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan can influence a student's ability to borrow Direct Unsubsidized Loans, entrance counseling is a mandatory step that ensures students are informed about their loans and responsibilities.","If a dependent student's parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student no longer qualifies for the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits.

1. **Graduate and Professional Students**: These students can apply for Direct PLUS Loans to help cover their education costs.

2. **Parents of Dependent Undergraduate Students**: A parent can receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who meets the eligibility criteria. 

For a parent to qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan, they must meet specific requirements, including citizenship and residency criteria. Additionally, they cannot be in default on a Title IV loan or owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay. Parents who have had a Title IV loan discharged due to total and permanent disability must also meet the same eligibility requirements as student borrowers.

Eligible parents include:
- The biological parent of the student.
- The legal adoptive parent of the student.
- The stepparent, provided they are required to provide their information on the FAFSA form.

Grandparents and other family members are not eligible to take out Direct PLUS Loans unless they have legally adopted the student.

"What are the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers, including those with adverse credit history, and what responsibilities do schools have in this process?","['Chapter 2\nDirect Loan Counseling\nCounseling Overview\nFirst-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a\nDirect Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled\non at least a half-time basis. There is a special counseling requirement for student and parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers\nwho meet the requirements to receive a Direct PLUS Loan after having been determined to have an adverse credit\nhistory. This chapter discusses the counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers and associated school\nresponsibilities.\nEntrance Counseling\nEntrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and student\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowers. Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner. For example, your entrance counseling\ncan include one or more of the following:\nExtra information as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means,\nwritten materials, or different methods;\nA requirement for first-time student borrowers to take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling (though\nyou cannot establish a passing score that they must achieve to get a Direct Loan);\nA requirement for students to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy\nand understanding of the implications of borrowing (but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan); or\nA requirement for students to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity.', 'You cannot require, but you can encourage borrowers to participate in counseling beyond entrance counseling to be\nbetter informed about borrowing, the terms of their Direct Loans, their repayment responsibilities and options, and the\nconsequences of default. Your school can also offer financial literacy classes, on a credit or non-credit basis, that include\ninformation on budgeting, debt management, anticipated earnings by profession, elements of loan counseling, etc.,\nthough eligibility for a Direct Loan cannot be contingent on completion of such a class.\nRequired Entrance Counseling Content for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrowers\nBelow we provide a summary of the information that must be covered in entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan\nand Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers.

A Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified through the\nDepartment9s National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as being in default on a Title IV loan and who has also been\ndetermined to have an adverse credit history (due to the default and/or other adverse credit conditions) cannot qualify for\na Direct PLUS Loan simply by obtaining an endorser or by providing acceptable documentation of extenuating\ncircumstances. The applicant must also separately resolve the default status by one of the means discussed under\n<Resolving Default Status= in Volume 1, Chapter 3.\nIn some cases, the Direct PLUS Loan credit check may not reveal a default on a Title IV loan, particularly if the default is\nnot recent. If a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant who is identified in NSLDS as being in default on a Title IV\nloan does not have any other adverse credit issues, the applicant will pass the PLUS credit check. In this circumstance you\ncannot assume that the approved credit check result supersedes the information in NSLDS. The default must be resolved\nbefore you can disburse Direct PLUS Loan funds or other Title IV aid to the applicant.\nDirect PLUS Loan Application\nSchools that offer Direct PLUS Loans have the option of requiring student and parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants to\ncomplete the Direct PLUS Loan Application (formally known as the ""Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request for Supplemental\nInformation"") on the Department\'s StudentAid.gov website as the first step in applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. The Direct\nPLUS Loan Application collects the requested loan amount, the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended, and\nother information related to processing the requested Direct PLUS Loan.\nUse of the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov is not required. Schools may choose to develop their own\nprocesses for obtaining the information needed to originate Direct PLUS Loans.\nAlthough the Department9s FAFSA Processing System (FPS) matches student Direct PLUS Loan applicants against NSLDS\nto determine if they are in default on a Title IV loan, it does not perform this match for parent Direct PLUS Loan applicants.\nHowever, the Department conducts an NSLDS default check on all Direct PLUS Loan applicants (both students and\nparents) who complete the Direct PLUS Loan Application on StudentAid.gov.\nSchools that use the Direct PLUS Loan Application are notified of the result of the NSLDS default check through the\nCommon Origination and Disbursement (COD) System.

Here’s a comprehensive overview:

### Counseling Requirements for Direct Loan Borrowers

1. **Entrance Counseling**:
   - **Who Must Complete**: All first-time student borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and student Direct PLUS Loans must complete entrance counseling before receiving their first disbursement. Parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers are exempt from this requirement.
   - **Content Covered**: The entrance counseling must include:
     - Explanation of the Master Promissory Note (MPN).
     - Importance of the loan repayment obligation.
     - Consequences of default, including adverse credit reports and collection procedures.
     - Obligation to repay the full loan amount regardless of program completion or employment status.
     - Sample monthly repayment amounts based on different levels of indebtedness.
     - Impact of the loan on eligibility for other financial aid.
     - Information on interest accrual and capitalization.
     - Definition of half-time enrollment and its consequences.
     - Importance of contacting the school if the borrower withdraws.

2. **Exit Counseling**:
   - All student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled at least half-time.

3. **PLUS Loan Credit Counseling for Adverse Credit History**:
   - Any student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit history must complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling on the Department’s StudentAid.gov website. This applies if they qualify for the loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting extenuating circumstances.

### Responsibilities of Schools

- **Ensure Completion**: Schools must ensure that first-time borrowers complete entrance counseling before disbursing loans. This can be done through in-person sessions, written forms, or online methods, with verification of completion.
- **Provide Expertise**: Schools must have someone knowledgeable about Title IV programs available to answer questions after counseling.
- **Additional Counseling**: While schools cannot require additional counseling beyond entrance counseling, they can encourage participation in further counseling or financial literacy classes, provided these do not impede timely loan disbursement.
- **Adverse Credit Checks**: Schools must be aware that a Direct PLUS Loan applicant identified as being in default on a Title IV loan must resolve that default before loan disbursement, regardless of the outcome of the credit check.

In summary, schools play a crucial role in facilitating the counseling process for Direct Loan borrowers, ensuring they understand their obligations and the implications of borrowing.","First-time student borrowers must complete entrance counseling before they can receive the first disbursement of a Direct Loan, and all student Direct Loan borrowers must complete exit counseling shortly before they cease to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis.

"How do exceptions to the normal loan period apply to Direct PLUS Loans when clinical work is involved, and what are the implications if a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passes away?","['may not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of\npayments while the student was enrolled at least half time.\nIf a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death,\nthe school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of\nthe original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent\nstudent (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4\nof this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate\na Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended.\nFor additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the\nFSA Handbook.\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term\nVolume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and\nnonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine\nweeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education\nprogram work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical\nWork in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below.\nIf clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard\nterm, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.\nIf a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the\nstarting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of\nthe clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on\nAugust 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not\nbegin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be\nthe beginning date of the term.\nIf the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a\nDirect Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the\ncase).\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\nsemesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the\nspring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as\nSeptember 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which\nit is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term.\nIf loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the\nnormal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies,\nand the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of\na fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that\nfall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1\nthrough June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1\nthrough June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for\ninformation on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits).\nIf there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work,\nand the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to\nbegin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two\nloan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.', ""Regardless of the length of the loan period, you may disburse a Direct Loan in a single installment if the loan is to cover a\nstudent's COA in a study abroad program and your school9s calculated cohort default rate is less than 5% for the most\nrecent fiscal year for which data are available.\nDirect Loan Disbursements for Completed Payment Periods\nThe Direct Loan Program regulations allow a school to include in a single disbursement the disbursements for any\npayment periods that have ended. However, the COD System (except for schools exempted because of low default rates)\nrequires schools to enter at least two anticipated disbursement dates. Therefore, when creating a loan origination record\nfor a Direct Loan when you intend to include in a disbursement loan proceeds for any payment periods that have been\ncompleted, you should enter the actual date you anticipate making the disbursement as the anticipated date for all\ndisbursements that would be included. For example, consider a school attempting to submit an origination when the data\nis as follows:\nLoan period: 09/01 - 05/30 (fall through spring)\nMinimum number of disbursements normally required: 2\nPayment period 1: 09/01 - 12/20\nPayment period 2: 01/06 - 05/30\nDate school creates origination record: 01/09\nIf you anticipate disbursing the loan proceeds for both payment periods on January 16, you should enter January 16 as the\ndate for both the first and second disbursements when you create the origination record.\nDirect Loan Disbursements Made After the Date of the Borrower9s Death\nIf a school learns that a student or parent Direct Loan borrower has died before one or more disbursements of a loan have\nbeen made, the school must cancel all pending disbursements. Direct Loan funds cannot be disbursed when there is no\npossibility of repayment. In addition, if a school is not informed of a student or parent borrower9s death until after one or\nmore loan disbursements have been made, the school must return to the Department the full amount of all loan funds\nthat were credited to the student9s school account after the date of the borrower9s death (if the post-death disbursement\ncreated a credit balance that was paid directly to the student or parent, the school is not responsible for returning the\ncredit balance amount).\nDisbursements after the date of the borrower9s death are most likely to occur when a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower\ndies. If an enrolled student dies, the school will generally learn of the death in a timely manner and can cancel any\npending loan disbursements. However, if a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower dies, the student or other family members\nStudy Abroad Program Exception\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(6)(i)(B)\nDirect Loan Disbursement After One or More Payment Periods Have Elapsed\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(4)(i)""]","['<1-hop>\n\nmay not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of payments while the student was enrolled at least half time.

For additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.', '<2-hop>\n\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and nonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","Exceptions to the normal loan period for Direct PLUS Loans apply when clinical work is involved in a student's program. If clinical work meets specific criteria to be included in a standard term or substantially equal nonstandard term, the loan period can be adjusted. For instance, if clinical work begins before the term starts, the loan period start date is set to the beginning of the clinical work. Conversely, if the clinical work ends after the term's end date, the loan period end date is adjusted to the end of the clinical work. This ensures that the loan period accurately reflects the time the student is engaged in clinical activities.

Regarding the implications of a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passing away, if the school is notified of the death, it must cancel any pending disbursements. If disbursements have already been made after the date of the borrower's death, the school is required to return those funds to the Department of Education. However, if a surviving parent is available, they may take out a new Direct PLUS Loan for the amount that needs to be returned. Additionally, if no surviving parent is available, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has technically ended. 

These provisions ensure that students can continue to receive financial support despite the unfortunate circumstances surrounding the parent borrower's death.","Exceptions to the normal loan period apply to Direct PLUS Loans when clinical work is involved by allowing the loan period start date to be the beginning date of the clinical work if it starts before the term, and the loan period end date to be the ending date of the clinical work if it ends after the term. This adjustment ensures that the loan period accurately reflects the duration of the clinical work. In the event that a parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan passes away, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended. This ensures that the student can continue to receive financial aid despite the change in circumstances.",0.8,1.0,0.84,0.956404281260378,0.571428570612245,0.16666666666666666,6.354825973510742,parent_document_rag

This requirement also applies to borrowers of Direct Unsubsidized Loans and student Direct PLUS Loans, but not to parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.

### Requirements for Entrance Counseling:
1. **Definition of First-Time Borrower**: A first-time borrower is defined as someone who has not previously received a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan.

2. **Content of Counseling**: The entrance counseling must cover several key topics, including:
   - Explanation of the Master Promissory Note (MPN).
   - Importance of the loan repayment obligation.
   - Consequences of default, including adverse credit reports and collection procedures.
   - Obligation to repay the full loan amount regardless of program completion or employment status.
   - Sample monthly repayment amounts based on different levels of indebtedness.
   - Impact of the loan on eligibility for other financial aid.
   - Information on how interest accrues and is capitalized.
   - Definition of half-time enrollment and its importance.
   - Importance of contacting the school if the borrower withdraws from their program.

3. **Delivery Methods**: Counseling can be conducted in various formats:
   - In-person sessions.
   - Written materials that the borrower signs and returns.
   - Online or interactive electronic means, with a requirement for the borrower to acknowledge receipt of the information.

4. **Completion Assurance**: Schools must ensure that students complete the counseling, which may include a test to assess their understanding of the loan terms.

5. **Additional Counseling**: While schools cannot require additional counseling beyond the entrance counseling, they can encourage participation in further financial literacy programs or workshops.

### Relation to Overall Direct Loan Counseling Process:
Entrance counseling is part of a broader Direct Loan counseling process that also includes exit counseling, which is required for all Direct Loan borrowers before they cease enrollment at least half-time. The overall counseling process aims to ensure that borrowers are well-informed about their loans, repayment responsibilities, and the implications of borrowing, thereby promoting responsible borrowing and financial literacy.

In summary, entrance counseling is a critical step for first-time Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers, ensuring they understand their obligations and the terms of their loans before receiving funds.","Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Subsidized Loan borrowers. This counseling provides comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan and the borrower's responsibility to repay it. It can be conducted in-person, through written forms, or online, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information. Schools must ensure that students complete the counseling, which may include a test of their understanding. This requirement is part of the broader Direct Loan counseling process, which also includes exit counseling for all student Direct Loan borrowers before they cease to be enrolled at least half-time.

How do student loan eligibility criteria and minimum loan periods interact when a student is ineligible for a term within a fall-winter-spring academic year?,"['period are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be\nenrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and\nspring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be\nenrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering\nthe fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s\nCOA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a\nschool initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of\nat least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily\ndrops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not\nrequired to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school\nto adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and\nspring quarters only.\nIn the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-\nonly loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring\nloan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would\nthen be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining\nthe student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods\nOther Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a\nstudent9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs\nassociated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the\nfall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine\nmonths.\nThe limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last\nterms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period.\nFor instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall\nterm or the spring term.\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when\nperiods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\nMinimum Loan Periods\nThe minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar.\nAs explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a\nDirect Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on\nwhether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard\nor nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the\ncase of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below.\nNonstandard terms may be one of the following types:\n1. \nNonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any\nother term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length.\nSE9W\nPeriod of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition\n34 CFR 685.102(b)', '2. \nNonstandard terms that are substantially equal, but one or more of the terms in the academic year\ncontains fewer than nine weeks.\nNon-\nSE9W\n3. \nNonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length (one or more of the terms in the academic\nyear differs in length from another term by more than two weeks).\nNon-\nSE9W\nWe refer to the first type of nonstandard term as <SE9W= nonstandard terms. We group the second and third types\ntogether and refer to them as <non-SE9W= nonstandard terms.\nPrograms with SE9W nonstandard terms are treated the same as standard-term programs for purposes of determining\nminimum loan period length and monitoring annual loan limits. However, programs with non-SE9W nonstandard terms are\ntreated the same as non-term programs for these purposes.\nNote that substantially equal nonstandard terms (the first two types of nonstandard terms described above) are treated\ndifferently for purposes of determining Direct Loan payment periods than for determining minimum loan period length\nand monitoring annual loan limits. As explained in Volume 1, Chapter 1, if a program is offered in standard terms or in\nnonstandard terms that are substantially equal in length (regardless of the length of the nonstandard term), the payment\nperiod is the term.\nHowever, for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and monitoring Direct Loan annual loan\nlimits, substantially equal nonstandard terms that contain fewer than nine weeks are treated the same as nonstandard\nterms that are not substantially equal. This means that if a program has substantially equal nonstandard terms that are\nless than nine weeks in length, you must make a Direct Loan disbursement each term (the same as would be the case if\nthe program were offered in standard terms), but the minimum loan period and the type of academic year used to\nmonitor Direct Loan annual loan limits must be determined in accordance with the rules that apply to non-term programs.\nFor detailed information on standard term, nonstandard term, and non-term programs, see Volume 1, Chapter 1.\nMinimum Loan Period: Standard Term and SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\nFor credit-hour programs with standard terms (semesters, quarters, or trimesters), or with SE9W\nnonstandard terms, the minimum loan period is a single academic term. For example, if a student will be enrolled in the\nfall semester only and will skip the spring semester, you may originate a loan with a loan period that covers only the fall\nterm.\nMinimum Loan Period: Clock-Hour, Non-Term, and Non-SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\nFor all other programs (i.e., clock-hour, non-term, and non-SE9W nonstandard term programs), the minimum\nloan period is generally the lesser of the program length (or remainder of the program, if there is less than full academic\nyear remaining) or the academic year. There are exceptions to this minimum loan period rule when originating loans for\ntransfer students, or for students who complete or otherwise cease enrollment in one program and then begin a different\nprogram at the same school. We discuss these exceptions in detail in Chapter 7 of this volume.\nMinimum Loan Period: Programs Offered in Modules\nIf a program is offered in modules, this does not change the minimum loan period rules for Direct Loans. For example, if a\nstandard or SE9W nonstandard term is divided into two or more modules, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is\nstill the term, even if the student does not attend all modules within the term. Similarly, if a clock-hour, non-term credit-\nMinimum Loan Period\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(10)(i)', ""If you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower has received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of their\nfinancial need, and the student is still enrolled for the loan period, you must return the subsidized loan amount for which\nthe student was ineligible and ask the student if they wish to replace the subsidized funds with a Direct Unsubsidized\nLoan. If the student agrees to accept the unsubsidized loan funds and they also received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for\nthe same loan period as the Direct Subsidized Loan, you may increase the amount of the Direct Unsubsidized Loan\ndisbursements by the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. If the student did\nnot receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you may originate a new Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the amount of the Direct\nSubsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. The new Direct Unsubsidized Loan must have the same loan\nperiod and disbursement dates as the Direct Subsidized Loan.\nIf the student does not agree to have the excess subsidized loan funds replaced by a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must\nstill return the ineligible Direct Subsidized Loan amount.\nIf you discover that a student received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of financial need after the student is no\nlonger enrolled for the loan period, you are not required to take any action to eliminate the excess subsidized loan\namount.\nIf you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower who was eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan instead received a\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan, you must correct the error (even if the loan period has ended) by submitting a downward\nadjustment to reduce or eliminate the Direct Unsubsidized Loan, as appropriate, and replacing it with the same amount of\nDirect Subsidized Loan funds. You may do this either by adjusting an existing Direct Subsidized Loan upwards, or, if the\nstudent does not have an existing Direct Subsidized Loan, by originating a new Direct Subsidized Loan. Replacing a Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan with a Direct Subsidized Loan in this circumstance does not require obtaining the student9s consent.\nDirect Loan Overawards\nAs explained in Volume 4, Chapter 3, an overaward exists when a student9s aid package exceeds their need or overall\nCOA. If you discover that a student who received Direct Loans has been overawarded and your school has already\nreceived and disbursed some or all of the Direct Loan funds, you have the following options:\nIf the student9s aid package includes a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, or a nonfederal education loan,\nand the aid package doesn9t already apply these loans toward the student9s SAI, you may choose to adjust the aid\npackage to have all or a portion of these loans replace the SAI, thus reducing or eliminating the overaward (for more\ndetail and examples, see <Substituting for the SAI= in Volume 3, Chapter 3).\nIf you have not yet made the second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan, you can reduce or cancel the\nsecond or subsequent disbursement.\nIf the overaward situation occurs after the full amount of a Direct Loan has been disbursed, you do not need to adjust the\namount of the loan. However, you might have to adjust the aid package to prevent an overaward of Campus-Based funds\nor to prevent the total aid package from exceeding the student9s need.\nAlthough a school isn9t required to return Direct Loan funds that were disbursed to the borrower (either directly or by\napplying them to the student's account) before the overaward situation occurred, the law doesn9t prevent your school\nfrom returning funds that were applied to the student account if you choose to do so. A borrower who receives a direct\npayment of loan funds is not required to repay an overawarded amount, unless the overaward was caused by the\nborrower9s misreporting or withholding of information.\nLoan Periods\nThe loan period (also referred to as the <period of enrollment=) is the period for which a Direct Loan is intended. It must\ncoincide with an academic period established by the school for which institutional charges are generally assessed (e.g.,\nsemester, trimester, quarter, length of the student9s program, or academic year). It9s important to define the loan period\nat the beginning of the loan awarding process, because the timing and amount of Direct Loan disbursements are tied to\nthe loan period.\nGenerally, the loan period may not include terms in which a student is ineligible (for example, if the student is not enrolled\nduring a particular term or is enrolled less than half time during a term). There is a limited exception to this rule if the loan\nperiod begins and ends with a term in which the student is eligible for Direct Loans, but the first and last terms of the loan""]","['<1-hop>\n\nperiod are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and spring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be enrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering the fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s COA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a school initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of at least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily drops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not required to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school to adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and spring quarters only. In the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring- only loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring loan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would then be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining the student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods Other Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a student9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs associated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the fall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months. The limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last terms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period. For instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall term or the spring term. Note: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when periods of clinical work are included in a standard term.', '<2-hop>\n\nMinimum Loan Periods The minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar. As explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on whether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard or nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the case of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below. Nonstandard terms may be one of the following types: 1. Nonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any other term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length. SE9W Period of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition 34 CFR 685.102(b)']","When a student is ineligible for a term within a fall-winter-spring academic year, the interaction between student loan eligibility criteria and minimum loan periods is governed by specific rules outlined in the provided context.

1. **Loan Period Definition**: The loan period (or period of enrollment) is the timeframe for which a Direct Loan is intended. It must align with the academic periods established by the school. Generally, a loan period cannot include terms in which a student is ineligible (e.g., not enrolled or enrolled less than half-time).

2. **Limited Exception**: There is a limited exception where a school may originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period even if the student is ineligible for the winter term, provided that the student is eligible for both the fall and spring terms. In this case, the school can still originate a loan covering all three terms, but costs associated with the winter quarter cannot be included in the student's Cost of Attendance (COA) when determining the loan amount for the fall and spring quarters.

3. **Adjustments to Loan Amounts**: If a student initially plans to attend all three terms but later decides not to attend the winter quarter or drops below half-time status, the school is not required to change the original loan period. However, it may need to adjust the loan amount based on the reduced costs for the fall and spring quarters only.

4. **Separate Loans Option**: The school has the option to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-only loan periods if the student is ineligible for the winter term. In this case, the school must subtract the student's full Student Aid Index (SAI) from the costs for each term when determining eligibility for Direct Subsidized Loans.

5. **Impact on Subsidized Loan Eligibility**: Using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding winter costs) allows the school to mitigate the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months, as it can subtract the full SAI from the combined costs of the fall and spring terms.

In summary, while a student’s ineligibility for a term can complicate loan origination, schools have flexibility in structuring loan periods and amounts, provided they adhere to the eligibility criteria and make necessary adjustments based on the student's enrollment status.","Student loan eligibility criteria allow a school to originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring period even if a student is ineligible for one of the terms, such as the winter quarter, provided the student is eligible during the first and last terms of the loan period. However, no costs associated with the ineligible term can be included in the student's Cost of Attendance (COA) when determining the loan amount. The minimum loan period for originating a Direct Loan depends on the school's academic calendar and whether the program is term-based or non-term. For term-based programs with nonstandard terms, the terms must be substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length. This interaction ensures that while students can receive loans for eligible terms, the loan amounts must be adjusted to reflect only the periods of eligibility, adhering to the minimum loan period requirements.",1.0,1.0,0.71,0.9504770286805102,0.29999999969999996,0.21052631578947367,6.8000710010528564,parent_document_rag
"How does proration apply to students in clock-hour programs when their remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year, and what are some examples of this proration process?","['Graduate Early From a Clock-Hour Program= later in this chapter).\nIn a standard-term program, or a credit-hour program using SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of\nstudy is considered shorter than an academic year if the remaining period contains fewer terms than the number of terms\ncovered by the school9s Title IV academic year. For programs that are offered in a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY; see\nChapter 6), the number of terms covered in the school9s Title IV academic year usually does not include a summer\n<header= or <trailer= term.\nConsider a student who is enrolled in a four-year program that is offered in an SAY consisting of three quarters plus a\nsummer trailer, and who has completed four academic years of study. The student needs to attend an additional quarter\nterm to complete the program requirements. The final quarter term falls in a new academic year; therefore the annual\nloan limit must be prorated because the remaining period of study (a single quarter) is less than a full academic year.\nSimilarly, if a student enrolled in a two-year program not offered in an SAY (where the Title IV academic year covers two\n15-week semesters) has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to\ncomplete the program requirements, the loan limit must be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester.\nNote that for standard-term programs or credit-hour programs with SE9W nonstandard terms, the length of the loan\nperiod does not determine whether a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic\nyear. The determining factor is the length of the remaining period of study in which the student is enrolled, which may not\nbe the same as the loan period. For example, if an undergraduate student is enrolled for a full SAY consisting of fall and\nspring semesters, and will complete the program at the end of the spring term, but is enrolled less than half time during\nthe spring, the student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan only for the fall semester. Although the loan period (fall only) is\nshorter than an academic year, the remaining period of study (fall through spring) is a full academic year. Therefore, if the\nstudent receives a Direct Loan in the fall, proration of the annual loan limit is not required.\nIn a clock-hour program, non-term program, or a program with non-SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining\nperiod of study is considered less than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program9s\ndefined Title IV academic year. In contrast to standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, if a student enrolled\nin a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is in a remaining period of study shorter than an\nacademic year and receives a Direct Loan, the loan period and the remaining period of study will always be the same. This\nis because for these programs the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program (or remaining portion of\na program) or the academic year.\nFor all types of programs, you determine the prorated loan limit for a student enrolled in a remaining period of study less\nthan an academic year by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by the following fraction:\nUnlike proration for programs that are shorter than an academic year, there is no comparison of weeks and hours. Only\nthe credit or clock hours that the student is scheduled to attend, or is actually attending, at the time of\norigination are used in the calculation.\nProration Examples: Remaining Periods of Study Shorter Than an Academic Year\nExamples 3 through 7 illustrate how the prorated annual loan limit is determined when a student is enrolled in a\nremaining period of study shorter than an academic year.\nSemester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours enrolled in program\nSemester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours in academic year\nVolume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3: Remaining Period = One Quarter', 'Prorating Loan Limits for Remaining Periods Shorter Than an Academic Year\nYou must also prorate loan limits for students enrolled in remaining periods of study shorter than an academic year.

Loan limits are not prorated based on a student9s enrollment status, such as when a student is\nenrolled less than full time, or when a student is enrolled for a period of less than a full academic year that is not a\nremaining period of study.\nThe annual loan limit for Direct Unsubsidized Loans is not prorated for students enrolled in graduate or professional level\nprograms. Loan proration requirements also do not apply to students taking preparatory coursework or coursework\nnecessary for teacher certification. This is because the annual loan limit must be prorated only when a student is enrolled\nin a program or remaining portion of a program that is shorter than an academic year. Students taking preparatory\ncoursework or teacher certification coursework are not considered to be enrolled in a program for purposes of awarding\nTitle IV aid.\nIt9s important to understand that loan limit proration determines the maximum loan amount that a student may borrow\nfor a program or remaining balance of a program, not the actual loan amount a student is eligible to receive.

You may choose to\nconvert the fraction to a decimal and then multiply the annual loan limit by the decimal, but this conversion is not a\nrequirement. However, you should be consistent in the method you use, since the fraction and decimal calculations\nsometimes result in slightly different prorated loan limits, as shown in the examples later in the chapter.\nUsing the School9s Academic Year Definition If Longer Than the Title IV Minimum\nAs explained above, proration of the annual loan limit is required when an undergraduate student is enrolled in a program\nthat is shorter than an academic year or is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year.\nA school may choose to define its academic year as longer in weeks or hours than the minimum statutory requirements.

In a standard-term program, or a credit-hour program using SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining period of study is considered shorter than an academic year if the remaining period contains fewer terms than the number of terms covered by the school9s Title IV academic year. For programs that are offered in a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY; see Chapter 6), the number of terms covered in the school9s Title IV academic year usually does not include a summer <header= or <trailer= term. Consider a student who is enrolled in a four-year program that is offered in an SAY consisting of three quarters plus a summer trailer, and who has completed four academic years of study. The student needs to attend an additional quarter term to complete the program requirements. The final quarter term falls in a new academic year; therefore the annual loan limit must be prorated because the remaining period of study (a single quarter) is less than a full academic year. Similarly, if a student enrolled in a two-year program not offered in an SAY (where the Title IV academic year covers two 15-week semesters) has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to complete the program requirements, the loan limit must be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester. Note that for standard-term programs or credit-hour programs with SE9W nonstandard terms, the length of the loan period does not determine whether a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year. The determining factor is the length of the remaining period of study in which the student is enrolled, which may not be the same as the loan period. For example, if an undergraduate student is enrolled for a full SAY consisting of fall and spring semesters, and will complete the program at the end of the spring term, but is enrolled less than half time during the spring, the student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan only for the fall semester. Although the loan period (fall only) is shorter than an academic year, the remaining period of study (fall through spring) is a full academic year. Therefore, if the student receives a Direct Loan in the fall, proration of the annual loan limit is not required.

This situation arises when a student is nearing the completion of their program but has not yet completed the full academic year as defined by the institution.

### How Proration Works:
1. **Definition of Remaining Period**: A remaining period of study is considered shorter than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program's defined Title IV academic year.
2. **Loan Period and Remaining Period**: In clock-hour programs, the loan period and the remaining period of study are the same, as the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program or the academic year.

### Proration Calculation:
To determine the prorated loan limit, the applicable annual loan limit is multiplied by a fraction that compares the hours or weeks in the remaining period to those in the academic year. The smaller of the two fractions is used for the calculation.

### Examples of Proration:
1. **Example of a Clock-Hour Program**:
   - A student is enrolled in a 400 clock-hour, 12-week program, while the school defines the academic year as 900 clock hours and 26 weeks.
   - The fractions for weeks and hours are calculated as follows:
     - Weeks: \( \frac{12}{26} = 0.46 \)
     - Hours: \( \frac{400}{900} = 0.44 \)
   - The smaller decimal (0.44) is used to calculate the prorated loan limit:
     - If the annual loan limit is $5,500, the prorated limit would be:
       \[
       5,500 \times 0.44 = 2,420
       \]
   - Thus, the student can borrow a maximum of $2,420.

2. **Example of a Non-Term Credit-Hour Program**:
   - An independent student is enrolled in a 24 quarter-hour, 20-week program, with the academic year defined as 36 quarter hours and 30 weeks.
   - The fractions are:
     - Weeks: \( \frac{20}{30} = 0.67 \)
     - Hours: \( \frac{24}{36} = 0.67 \)
   - The prorated annual loan limit would be:
     \[
     9,500 \times 0.67 = 6,365
     \]
   - The maximum portion of this that can be in subsidized loans is calculated similarly:
     \[
     3,500 \times 0.67 = 2,345
     \]
   - Therefore, the student can borrow a total of $6,365, with a maximum of $2,345 in subsidized loans.

### Conclusion:
Proration ensures that students in clock-hour programs receive loan amounts that accurately reflect their remaining study time, preventing them from borrowing more than they are eligible for based on their program's structure.","In clock-hour programs, if a student's remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year, the loan limit must be prorated. This is because the remaining period consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program's defined Title IV academic year. Unlike standard-term programs, the loan period and the remaining period of study in clock-hour programs will always be the same, as the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program or the academic year. Proration is determined by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by a fraction based on the credit or clock hours the student is scheduled to attend. Examples of this proration process include scenarios where a student is enrolled in a remaining period of one quarter, as illustrated in Volume 8, Chapter 5, Example 3.",1.0,0.9523809523809523,0.5,0.9408546118514539,0.2222222219753086,0.075,15.733106136322021,parent_document_rag
"How does the NSLDS system assist in managing borrower information and loan limits, particularly in relation to unallocated consolidation loan amounts?","['teacher certification and preparatory coursework and the applicable annual loan limits.)\nHigher Aggregate Loan Limit for Certain Health Professions Students\nAs explained earlier in this chapter, graduate and professional students who are enrolled in certain health professions\nprograms are eligible for higher annual Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits. These students also have a higher combined\nsubsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit.\nThe combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit for graduate and professional health professions students\nwho are eligible to receive the increased annual unsubsidized amounts is $224,000. Not more than $65,500 of this\namount may be from subsidized loans (see the notes following Table 4 above regarding the $65,500 subsidized aggregate\nloan limit for graduate and professional students).\nIf a student who received increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts for a qualifying health profession program later\nenrolls in a non-health professions program, the student is no longer eligible for the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan\nlimits. However, the additional loan amounts received for the health professions program are not counted toward the\nnormal aggregate loan limit for that student.\nChecking Remaining Eligibility Under the Aggregate Loan Limits\nBefore originating a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, it9s important to make sure the student still has\nremaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limits. As long as there is no conflicting information, you may rely on the\nfinancial aid history (provided on the ISIR as well as on the NSLDS Professional Access website) and the Transfer Student\nMonitoring process (for transfer students only) to tell you if a student is about to exceed the applicable aggregate loan\nlimit. (See Volume 1, Chapter 3 for more detail on NSLDS financial aid history, which may also affect eligibility for other\nTitle IV programs.)\nThe Loan History in NSLDS for a borrower who has received Title IV loans shows Aggregate Loan Information for the\nborrower9s outstanding subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding\nPrincipal Balance amounts shown for a borrower in NSLDS do not include unpaid accrued interest, capitalized interest\n(unpaid interest that has been added to the principal balance of the loan), or other charges, as these amounts are not\ncounted against the aggregate loan limits.\nFor each individual loan that a borrower has received, NSLDS shows both the Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) and the\nAggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). The OPB is what the borrower owes, which may include capitalized\ninterest and other charges. The Agg. OPB is the portion of the OPB that counts against the aggregate loan limits for\nsubsidized and unsubsidized loans.\nFor instance, suppose a student has a Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursed in the amount of $5,000. Over time, $200 in\ninterest accrues and is capitalized. Assuming that the borrower has made no payments on the loan, the OPB on the loan\nwill be $5,200 (this is the amount the borrower owes), and the Agg. OPB will be $5,000 (this is the amount that is counted\nagainst the aggregate loan limit). If you are looking at information in NSLDS for individual loans, it is the Agg. OPB that\nyou should use to determine the student9s remaining loan eligibility under the applicable aggregate loan limit.\nThe Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance amounts displayed in NSLDS for a borrower\nalso include the outstanding portion of consolidation loans (both Direct Consolidation Loans and Federal Consolidation\nLoans made under the FFEL program) attributable to Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Subsidized\nFederal Stafford Loans, and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans that were repaid by the consolidation loan.\nUnallocated Consolidation Loan Amounts\nNSLDS may also show a <Consolidation Loans, Unallocated= amount that is not counted against a borrower9s aggregate\nloan limits. The <Consolidation Loans, Unallocated= amount represents the portion of a consolidation loan that cannot be\nattributed to other loans in the borrower9s loan history. For example, it may represent capitalized interest or non-Title IV\nloans that were consolidated. You are not responsible for determining the origin of any unallocated consolidation loan\namounts.\nTreatment of Consolidated Perkins Loans and PLUS Loans\nA consolidated Perkins Loan or PLUS loan becomes part of the unsubsidized portion of a consolidation loan, but it is not', 'Repayment of the Excess Loan Amount\nIf a student who has inadvertently overborrowed wishes to regain Title IV eligibility by repaying the excess loan amount,\nthe student must contact the applicable servicer and comply with the servicer9s repayment instructions. The school may\nassist the student in identifying and contacting the servicer, but the student, not the school, must make the payment of\nthe excess loan funds in accordance with the servicer9s instructions. Once the student has repaid the excess loan amount\nin full, the servicer will send the student confirmation that the excess loan amount has been repaid. The student or\nservicer must provide a copy of the repayment confirmation to the school. The inadvertent overborrowing is considered to\nhave been resolved as of the date the servicer received the borrower9s full payment of the excess loan amount.\nSatisfactory Repayment Arrangements (<Reaffirmation=)\nA student who has inadvertently overborrowed may also regain Title IV eligibility by making satisfactory repayment\narrangements to repay the excess loan amount. This requirement can be met if the student agrees in writing to repay the\nexcess amount according to the terms and conditions of the promissory note that supported the loan. This is called\n<reaffirmation.= The reaffirmation process includes the following five steps:\n1. Either the student or the school where the student is requesting additional Title IV funds contacts the servicer of the\nloan that caused the overborrowing and explains that the student has inadvertently overborrowed and wishes to\nreaffirm the debt.\n2. The servicer sends the student a reaffirmation agreement.\n3. The student reads, signs, and returns the reaffirmation agreement to the servicer.\n4. The servicer sends the student confirmation that the reaffirmation agreement has been accepted. The student or\nservicer must provide a copy of the confirmation to the school where the student is requesting Title IV funds.\n5. The inadvertent overborrowing is considered to have been resolved as of the date the servicer receives the student9s\nsigned reaffirmation agreement.\nConsolidation of Loan Amounts That Exceed the Annual or Aggregate Loan Limit\nIf a borrower who inadvertently received more than the annual or aggregate loan limits has consolidated the loan(s) that\ncaused the borrower to exceed the loan limit into a Direct Consolidation Loan, the Direct Consolidation Loan is considered\na satisfactory arrangement to repay the excess amount. This restores the borrower9s eligibility for Title IV aid. If the school\nwhere the student is seeking aid confirms through NSLDS that the loan(s) have been consolidated, no further action is\nrequired. Note, however, that consolidation of an amount that exceeded the combined aggregate loan limit for Direct\nSubsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans does not automatically make a student eligible for additional Direct Loan\nfunds.\nbefore the student can receive additional Title IV aid.\nRegaining Title IV Eligibility After Inadvertent Overborrowing\n34 CFR 668.35(d)\nDCL GEN-15-20\nDCL GEN-13-02\nDepartment of Education Office of the Inspector General Hotline', ""Graduate program in Public Health (including Master's and Doctoral\ndegree programs in Public Health)\nCouncil on Education for Public Health\nDoctor of Chiropractic\nCouncil on Chiropractic Education, Commission\non Accreditation\nDoctoral Degree in Clinical Psychology\nAmerican Psychological Association,\nCommittee on Accreditation\nMaster's or Doctoral Degree in Health Administration\nCommission on Accreditation of Healthcare\nManagement Education\nThe increased unsubsidized amounts that an eligible health professions student may receive are in addition to the regular\n$20,500 Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual loan limit for graduate and professional students. For example, a student\nenrolled in a nine-month Doctor of Dentistry program is eligible for the regular Direct Unsubsidized Loan annual maximum\nfor a graduate or professional student ($20,500), plus the maximum increased unsubsidized amount of $20,000, for a\ntotal Direct Unsubsidized Loan maximum of $40,500 per academic year.\nGraduate and professional students who qualify for the higher annual Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits are also eligible for\na higher combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit, as explained later in this chapter.\nProration of the Increased Health Professions Annual Loan Limit for an Academic Year Covering 10 or 11 Months\nTables 3A and 3B above show the increased unsubsidized loan limits for programs with an academic year of either nine\nmonths or 12 months. For eligible health professions programs with an academic year covering 10 or 11 months, the\nannual additional unsubsidized loan limit must be prorated. If the academic year covers 10 or 11 months, the prorated\nannual loan limit is determined by dividing the applicable loan limit for an academic year covering nine months by nine,\nand then multiplying the result by 10 or 11. For example, the prorated increased unsubsidized loan limit for a Doctor of\nDentistry program with an 11-month academic year would be $24,444, calculated as follows:\n$20,000 ÷ 9 = $2,222.22\n$2,222.22 x 11 = $24,444.42, rounded to $24,444\nForeign Schools May Not Award Increased Unsubsidized Loan Amounts\nForeign schools that participate in the Direct Loan Program may not award the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan\namounts to health professions students.\nAggregate Loan Limit Overview\nAs explained earlier in this chapter, there are limits on the maximum Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan\namounts that a student may receive each academic year (annual loan limits). There are also limits on a student9s\nmaximum outstanding total Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan debt. These are called aggregate loan\nlimits. A borrower who has reached the aggregate borrowing limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized\nLoans may not receive additional loans. Once the loans are repaid, in full or in part, the borrower may apply for additional\nloans.\nTo ensure that a student doesn9t exceed the aggregate loan limits, the student9s FAFSA form data is matched with NSLDS.\nIf the student has exceeded or is approaching the aggregate loan limits, this will be noted in the ISIR. If a student\ntransfers to your school, you must inform NSLDS so that it can begin the Transfer Student Monitoring process.\nAggregate Loan Limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\nThe aggregate loan limits for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are shown in Table 4 below.""]","[""<1-hop>\n\nprovided by those companies are already offered free of charge through the Department or the borrower's loan servicer; Provide a general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers (i.e. student loan interest deduction); and Require the borrower to provide current information concerning their name, address, Social Security number, references, and driver9s license number and state of issuance, as well as the borrower9s expected permanent address, the address of their next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower9s expected employer, if known (see also < Providing Borrower Information at Separation= below).

Treatment of Consolidated Perkins Loans and PLUS Loans A consolidated Perkins Loan or PLUS loan becomes part of the unsubsidized portion of a consolidation loan, but it is not']","The National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) plays a crucial role in managing borrower information and loan limits, particularly concerning unallocated consolidation loan amounts. Here’s how it assists in this process:

1. **Loan History Tracking**: NSLDS provides a comprehensive loan history for borrowers, detailing both the Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) and the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). The OPB reflects the total amount owed, including capitalized interest, while the Agg. OPB indicates the portion that counts against the aggregate loan limits. This distinction is essential for determining a borrower's remaining eligibility for loans.

2. **Aggregate Loan Limits**: The system helps ensure that borrowers do not exceed their aggregate loan limits by displaying the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance amounts for subsidized and unsubsidized loans. This information is critical for financial aid administrators to verify a student's eligibility before originating new loans.

3. **Unallocated Consolidation Loan Amounts**: NSLDS may show an ""Unallocated"" amount for consolidation loans, which represents portions of a consolidation loan that cannot be attributed to specific loans in the borrower’s history. This could include capitalized interest or non-Title IV loans. Importantly, these unallocated amounts do not count against the borrower’s aggregate loan limits, allowing for a clearer understanding of the borrower's actual borrowing capacity.

4. **No Responsibility for Origin Determination**: Financial aid administrators are not responsible for determining the origin of unallocated consolidation loan amounts. This simplifies the process for schools and ensures that they can focus on the borrower's eligibility without needing to trace the specifics of each loan's origin.

In summary, NSLDS assists in managing borrower information and loan limits by providing detailed loan histories, tracking aggregate loan limits, and clarifying the treatment of unallocated consolidation loan amounts, which helps maintain compliance with federal loan regulations.","The NSLDS system assists in managing borrower information by providing loan holders with the necessary data during the exit counseling process, as part of the Department's online counseling services.

If the student agrees to accept the unsubsidized loan funds and they also received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the same loan period as the Direct Subsidized Loan, you may increase the amount of the Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursements by the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. If the student did not receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you may originate a new Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. The new Direct Unsubsidized Loan must have the same loan period and disbursement dates as the Direct Subsidized Loan. If the student does not agree to have the excess subsidized loan funds replaced by a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must still return the ineligible Direct Subsidized Loan amount. If you discover that a student received Direct Subsidized Loan funds in excess of financial need after the student is no longer enrolled for the loan period, you are not required to take any action to eliminate the excess subsidized loan amount. If you discover that, due to an error, a student borrower who was eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan instead received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must correct the error (even if the loan period has ended) by submitting a downward adjustment to reduce or eliminate the Direct Unsubsidized Loan, as appropriate, and replacing it with the same amount of Direct Subsidized Loan funds. You may do this either by adjusting an existing Direct Subsidized Loan upwards, or, if the student does not have an existing Direct Subsidized Loan, by originating a new Direct Subsidized Loan. Replacing a Direct Unsubsidized Loan with a Direct Subsidized Loan in this circumstance does not require obtaining the student9s consent. Direct Loan Overawards As explained in Volume 4, Chapter 3, an overaward exists when a student9s aid package exceeds their need or overall COA. If you discover that a student who received Direct Loans has been overawarded and your school has already received and disbursed some or all of the Direct Loan funds, you have the following options: If the student9s aid package includes a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, or a nonfederal education loan, and the aid package doesn9t already apply these loans toward the student9s SAI, you may choose to adjust the aid package to have all or a portion of these loans replace the SAI, thus reducing or eliminating the overaward (for more detail and examples, see <Substituting for the SAI= in Volume 3, Chapter 3). If you have not yet made the second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan, you can reduce or cancel the second or subsequent disbursement. If the overaward situation occurs after the full amount of a Direct Loan has been disbursed, you do not need to adjust the amount of the loan. However, you might have to adjust the aid package to prevent an overaward of Campus-Based funds or to prevent the total aid package from exceeding the student9s need. Although a school isn9t required to return Direct Loan funds that were disbursed to the borrower (either directly or by applying them to the student's account) before the overaward situation occurred, the law doesn9t prevent your school from returning funds that were applied to the student account if you choose to do so. A borrower who receives a direct payment of loan funds is not required to repay an overawarded amount, unless the overaward was caused by the borrower9s misreporting or withholding of information.""]","The Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) facilitates compliance with Direct Loan exit counseling requirements by providing schools with notifications of online loan counseling completed by borrowers.

How does the FSA Handbook guide schools in handling loan adjustments for clinical work and the death of a Title IV aid recipient?,"['Volume 8\nThe Direct Loan Program\nIntroduction\nUnder the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loan Program), the U.S. Department of Education (the\nDepartment) makes loans to help students and parents pay the cost of attendance (COA) at a postsecondary school. This\nvolume of the Federal Student Aid Handbook provides information to assist schools in determining student and parent\neligibility for Direct Loans, counseling student borrowers, and awarding Direct Loans.\nChanges for 2025-2026\nWe have made the following changes in Volume 8 for 2025-2026:\nIn Chapter 3, we have revised the discussion of loan periods to provide a limited exception to the longstanding\nrequirement that the loan period for a Direct Loan may not include any terms in which the borrower is ineligible to\nreceive Direct Loan funds.\nAlso in Chapter 3, we have added a slightly revised and expanded version of guidance on the treatment of Direct\nLoan disbursements made after the date of a borrower9s death that was previously in Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the FSA\nHandbook under the heading <Checking Eligibility at the Time of Disbursement.= Because this guidance is specific to\nDirect Loans, we believe Volume 8 is a more appropriate location.\nIn Chapter 5, we have revised Example 6 to reflect the limited exception to the requirement that a loan period may\nnot include terms in which the borrower is ineligible (see Chapter 3 changes above).\nIn Chapter 7, we have revised the discussion of transfer students and abbreviated loan periods to clarify that in some\ncircumstances a transfer student may be eligible to receive more Direct Loan funds for the program at the new\nschool than a non-transfer student would be eligible to receive for that same program.\nExcept as noted above, there are no other substantive changes to Volume 8 for 2025-2026.', 'may not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of\npayments while the student was enrolled at least half time.\nIf a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death,\nthe school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of\nthe original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent\nstudent (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4\nof this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate\na Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended.\nFor additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the\nFSA Handbook.\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term\nVolume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and\nnonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine\nweeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education\nprogram work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical\nWork in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter.

However, the COD System (except for schools exempted because of low default rates)\nrequires schools to enter at least two anticipated disbursement dates. Therefore, when creating a loan origination record\nfor a Direct Loan when you intend to include in a disbursement loan proceeds for any payment periods that have been\ncompleted, you should enter the actual date you anticipate making the disbursement as the anticipated date for all\ndisbursements that would be included. For example, consider a school attempting to submit an origination when the data\nis as follows:\nLoan period: 09/01 - 05/30 (fall through spring)\nMinimum number of disbursements normally required: 2\nPayment period 1: 09/01 - 12/20\nPayment period 2: 01/06 - 05/30\nDate school creates origination record: 01/09\nIf you anticipate disbursing the loan proceeds for both payment periods on January 16, you should enter January 16 as the\ndate for both the first and second disbursements when you create the origination record.\nDirect Loan Disbursements Made After the Date of the Borrower9s Death\nIf a school learns that a student or parent Direct Loan borrower has died before one or more disbursements of a loan have\nbeen made, the school must cancel all pending disbursements. Direct Loan funds cannot be disbursed when there is no\npossibility of repayment. In addition, if a school is not informed of a student or parent borrower9s death until after one or\nmore loan disbursements have been made, the school must return to the Department the full amount of all loan funds\nthat were credited to the student9s school account after the date of the borrower9s death (if the post-death disbursement\ncreated a credit balance that was paid directly to the student or parent, the school is not responsible for returning the\ncredit balance amount).\nDisbursements after the date of the borrower9s death are most likely to occur when a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower\ndies.

If a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death, the school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent student (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4 of this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended.

If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","The FSA Handbook provides specific guidance for schools regarding loan adjustments in two key situations: the death of a Title IV aid recipient and the inclusion of clinical work in loan periods.

1. **Handling Loan Adjustments for the Death of a Title IV Aid Recipient**:
   - If a school learns that a student or parent Direct Loan borrower has died before any disbursements have been made, the school must cancel all pending disbursements. Direct Loan funds cannot be disbursed when there is no possibility of repayment.
   - If the school is informed of the death after one or more disbursements have been made, it must return the full amount of all loan funds credited to the student’s account after the date of the borrower’s death. However, if a credit balance was created and paid directly to the student or parent, the school is not responsible for returning that amount.
   - In cases where a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower dies, the school should check if there is a surviving parent who can take out a new Direct PLUS Loan for the amount that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended.

2. **Loan Adjustments for Clinical Work**:
   - The Handbook outlines that if clinical work is included in a standard term or a substantially equal nonstandard term (SE9W) and meets specific criteria, it can affect the loan period and disbursement rules.
   - If clinical work begins before the term starts, the loan period start date is adjusted to the beginning of the clinical work. Conversely, if the clinical work ends after the term's end date, the loan period end date is adjusted to the end of the clinical work.
   - For example, if a fall semester includes clinical work starting on August 15, the loan period would be reported as August 15 through May 31, rather than starting on September 1.

These guidelines ensure that schools manage loan disbursements appropriately in the event of a borrower’s death and when clinical work impacts the academic calendar. For further details on actions required when a Title IV aid recipient dies, schools can refer to Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.","The FSA Handbook provides guidance for schools on handling loan adjustments in two specific scenarios. Firstly, when a Title IV aid recipient dies, the school must determine if there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original loan that must be returned. If not, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended. This is detailed in Appendix B of the FSA Handbook. Secondly, for clinical work included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the FSA Handbook allows for exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules. If clinical work begins before or ends after the normal term dates, the loan period start and end dates must be adjusted accordingly. This ensures that the academic year period and payment period dates align with the clinical work schedule, as explained in Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook.",0.7142857142857143,1.0,0.77,0.9832475598129765,0.49999999949999996,0.25,6.858074188232422,parent_document_rag

Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\ndocument.\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\nto answer students9 questions.

One such situation is when a dependent undergraduate qualifies for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, but in a subsequent academic year the student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan. In this circumstance the dependent student no longer qualifies for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts at the higher independent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits. During any academic year when a dependent student9s parent qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan, the student is subject to the dependent undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student otherwise would have been eligible to receive under the dependent undergraduate annual loan limits are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the $31,000 combined subsidized and unsubsidized dependent undergraduate aggregate limit (see Example 3 below). A similar situation occurs when a student who received loans for a graduate or professional degree program later returns to school and enrolls in an undergraduate program. The student is then subject to the undergraduate annual and aggregate loan limits, but only loan amounts the student previously received as an undergraduate are counted when determining the student9s remaining eligibility under the undergraduate aggregate loan limit (see Example 2 earlier in this chapter). Volume 8, Chapter 4, Example 3: Aggregate Loan Limits and Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan Amounts When Parents Are Unable To Obtain Direct PLUS Loans A dependent student receives additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the additional amounts available to independent undergraduates) for the first three years of a four-year program because the student9s parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan for each of those years. For each of the first three years, the student receives the maximum subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts under the independent student annual loan limits (remember that the annual subsidized maximums are the same for dependent and independent undergraduates): First Year (independent student loan limit) $3,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Second Year (independent student loan limit) $4,500 subsidized $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum) Third Year (independent student loan limit) $5,500 subsidized $7,000 unsubsidized ($5,000 more than dependent maximum) Total $13,500 subsidized $19,000 unsubsidized ($13,000 more than dependent maximum) In the fourth year, the parent is eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, so the student is then subject to the annual and aggregate loan limits for a dependent undergraduate. The dependent student received a total of $13,500 in Direct Subsidized Loan funds and $19,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds ($32,500 combined subsidized and unsubsidized total) for the first three years when the student9s parent was unable to obtain Direct PLUS Loans.

The context indicates that if a parent cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the student is allowed to borrow additional unsubsidized funds. However, there is no mention of a student's Direct Unsubsidized Loan eligibility being affected if the parent becomes eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan.

Entrance counseling plays a crucial role in the loan process for first-time borrowers. It is required for all first-time student borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and student Direct PLUS Loans. This counseling provides comprehensive information about the terms and conditions of the loans, as well as the borrower's responsibilities regarding repayment. Schools must ensure that students complete this counseling before the first disbursement of their loans.
