Direct Unsubsidized Loans for Students Whose Parents Have Ended Financial Support or Refuse To File a FAFSA Form If you verify that the parents of a dependent undergraduate student have refused to complete the parental information sections of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they have ended financial support for the student, you may make a professional judgment decision to offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount up to the applicable annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these circumstances a dependent second-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume for information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of the other Title IV programs. Self-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or have refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated statement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students without parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide. Direct PLUS Loans Direct PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate students. A parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who meets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a student. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent who had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements outlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal government holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s ineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student is otherwise eligible. Requirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers Schools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan Program and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available to both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit Direct PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students.

What happens to Direct Loan disbursements if a student drops to less-than-half-time enrollment?,"['Direct Loan Eligibility After an Enrollment Status Change If a student who received a disbursement of Direct Loan funds prior to the first day of classes of a payment period begins attendance on a less-than-half-time basis, there is no requirement for the school or the student to return the loan funds as long as: The student began attendance in at least one course during the payment period; and At the time of the loan disbursement the student was enrolled (registered) for classes on at least a half-time basis. However, the school must not make any subsequent disbursements of the loan unless the student resumes enrollment on at least a half-time basis during the payment period. A student who is no longer enrolled at least half time may not receive as a late disbursement any second or subsequent disbursement of the loan. Note that different requirements apply if a student who received a Direct Loan disbursement prior to the first day of classes fails to begin attendance in any classes. See <When A Student Fails to Begin Attendance= in Volume 4, Chapter 3. If a student does not withdraw but ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a school may make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred by the student for a period in which the student was eligible. However, this does not apply if the student dropped all future classes or modules, because the student never began classes as a half-time student. Title IV program funds (including Direct Loans) are disbursed to a student on the presumption that the student will attend the hours for which aid has been awarded. Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of a Direct Loan until a student has begun attendance in enough hours to establish half-time enrollment status. However, if a school has not yet made a Direct Loan disbursement to a student who has dropped classes, and the school determines that the student never began attendance in enough classes to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan to that student. Likewise, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules drops all future classes before beginning attendance in enough modules to establish half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan because the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis. If a student who dropped to less-than-half-time status resumes enrollment on a half-time basis during the payment period or period of enrollment, the school may make remaining disbursements of a Direct Loan if the school documents (1) the student9s revised COA, and (2) that the student continues to qualify for the entire amount of the loan, despite any reduction in the student9s COA caused by the temporary cessation of enrollment on at least a half-time basis.

How does a concerned parent navigate the credit hours and Direct Loan eligibility for their child's higher education when the program uses BBAY 2 and is not in a traditional academic year calendar?,"['<1-hop>\n\nBBAY 2 for Standard-Term Programs and SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs Without an SAY If a program with standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms is not offered in a traditional academic year calendar (SAY), BBAY 2 must be used. If the program uses semesters or trimesters, a BBAY 2 consists of any two consecutive terms. If the program uses quarters, a BBAY 2 consists of any three consecutive terms. If the program uses SE9W nonstandard terms, a BBAY 2 consists of the number of consecutive terms that coincide with the weeks of instructional time in the program9s academic year. As with the optional BBAY 1 that may be used for programs with an SAY, BBAY 2 may include terms that a student does not attend (as long as the student could have enrolled at least half time in those terms), but it must begin with a term in which the student is enrolled (even if the student is enrolled less than half time during the first term and therefore ineligible to receive a Direct Loan for that term). Unlike the optional BBAY 1 for programs offered in an SAY, there is no exception to the minimum academic year requirements for a BBAY 2 that includes a summer term. This means that the BBAY 2 for standard-term programs that are not offered in a traditional academic calendar, or for SE9W nonstandard term programs not offered in a comparable academic calendar, must always include enough terms to meet the minimum Title IV academic year requirements for weeks of instructional time. As with BBAY 1, any modules (summer or otherwise) that run consecutively within a term must be combined and treated as a single term. The COA cannot include costs for a module for which the student is not expected to be enrolled. A student doesn9t have to be enrolled in each module but must be able to enroll at least half time in the combined term. The annual loan limit applies to the BBAY 2. Once the calendar period associated with all of the terms in the BBAY 2 has elapsed, a student regains eligibility for a new annual loan limit. BBAY 3 for Clock-Hour, Non-Term Credit-Hour, and Non-SE9W Nonstandard-Term Programs All clock-hour programs, non-term credit-hour programs, and non-SE9W nonstandard-term programs must use a BBAY 3 that meets the minimum requirements for an academic year. That is, the BBAY 3 must contain at least 30 weeks (or, for clock-hour programs, 26 weeks) of instructional time and: For undergraduate programs, a minimum of 24 semester or trimester hours, 36 quarter hours, or 900 clock hours; or For graduate programs, at least the number of hours a student would complete under the school9s full-time standard in weeks of the Title IV academic year, which must be a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time for credit-hour programs, or at least 26 weeks of instructional time for clock-hour programs. The BBAY 3 begins when a student enrolls and does not end until the later of the date the student successfully completes the hours in the academic year or the number of weeks of instructional time in the academic year. Because a student must successfully complete the minimum number of hours or weeks of instructional time in an academic year (whichever comes later) before a new BBAY 3 begins, a student9s enrollment status may affect how soon the student', '<2-hop>\n\nVolume 8, Chapter 6, Example 6: BBAY 2 First BBAY 2 Second BBAY 2 Third BBAY 2 Semester 1 + Semester 2 Semester 3 + Semester 4 (not enrolled in Semester 4) Semester 5 + Semester 6 A school has a program that measures academic progress in credit hours and uses 15-week semesters, but it is not offered in a traditional academic year calendar (SAY).

How do the disbursement rules for Pell Grants and Title IV funds differ in clock-hour programs compared to subscription-based programs?,"['<1-hop>\n\nboth the credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, the disbursement of Pell Grants is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods established at the beginning of the program. These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student's rate of progression. However, if a student accelerates, it may affect Direct Loan eligibility, potentially requiring proration of the loan limit in the final academic year. In contrast, for subscription-based programs, there is no requirement for students to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds for the first two subscription periods. For subsequent periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the hours enrolled in all previously attended periods, excluding the most recent one.

"In what circumstances can a Direct PLUS Loan be originated for a surviving parent or a dependent student, and how do exceptions to the normal loan period apply when clinical work is included in a standard term?","['<1-hop>\n\nmay not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of payments while the student was enrolled at least half time. If a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death, the school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of the original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent student (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4 of this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended. For additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the FSA Handbook.', '<2-hop>\n\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and nonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","A Direct PLUS Loan can be originated for a surviving parent or a dependent student if a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds due to the death of the parent borrower, and there is no surviving parent to take out a new Direct PLUS Loan. In this case, the school may also award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds to the dependent student, even if the loan period has ended. Exceptions to the normal loan period apply when clinical work is included in a standard term. If clinical work begins before the starting date of the term, the loan period start date is adjusted to the beginning date of the clinical work. Similarly, if the clinical work ends after the term's ending date, the loan period end date is adjusted to the ending date of the clinical work.

"How is Pell Grant eligibility determined for students enrolled in correspondence programs, and what are the specific payment period requirements?","['<1-hop>\n\nThe cost of attendance (COA) for students engaged in a program of study by correspondence must include tuition and fees and, if required, books, course materials, supplies, and equipment. A school may also include an allowance for travel, housing, and food costs incurred specifically for a period of residential training. The COA must be based on the costs for a full-time student for a full academic year for the relevant component. If the student9s program or period of enrollment, as measured in credit hours, is longer or shorter than an academic year as measured in credit hours, the tuition and fees for the program or enrollment period must be prorated. Because the correspondence study COA for the nonresidential component only includes costs associated with credit hours, your school always uses the credit-hour-related fraction to prorate the COA. (Because there are no costs associated with weeks of instructional time in the correspondence cost of attendance, your school must prorate the cost only if the number of hours in the program is shorter or longer than in an academic year): Credit hours in program9s definition of an academic year ÷ Credit hours to which the costs apply The resulting amount is the full-time, full-academic-year cost used for calculating Pell Grant eligibility. Pell Enrollment Intensity for Correspondence Study Programs Students enrolled in programs of correspondence study are no more than half-time students (the equivalent of 50% enrollment intensity), even if they are enrolled in enough coursework to be full time. However, if the correspondence study is combined with regular coursework, the student9s enrollment intensity might be more than 50%. For a student enrolled in a term-based correspondence program, your school must determine how many credits to include in the numerator of the enrollment intensity formula to determine the student9s annual award. See the <Students taking a combination of regular and correspondence courses= section in Chapter 3 for additional guidance. A student enrolled only in a non-term correspondence program always has their award calculated based on 50% enrollment intensity. Pell Correspondence Payment Periods and Timing of Payments For a non-term correspondence program, there must be two equal payment periods in each academic year. Each payment period is the lesser of half the academic year or half the program (measured in credit hours). In addition, you can9t disburse a Pell payment for the first payment period until the student has completed 25% of the work in the academic year or the program, whichever is shorter. You can9t make the second payment until the student has completed 75% of the work in the academic year or program. For a term-based correspondence program, as for other term-based programs, the payment period is the term. However, you can9t disburse Pell for a payment period until the student has completed 50% of the lessons or completes 50% of the work for the term, whichever is later. If the correspondence program has a required period of residential training, you must treat the residential training as an additional payment period and determine the payment for that payment period using either Formula 3 or Formula 4. Note that the correspondence portion of the program is still treated as a separate portion of the program that9s divided into equal payment periods.', '<2-hop>\n\nPell Calculations in Correspondence Programs Formula 5 is used for students enrolled only in correspondence courses (not including residential components of correspondence programs).

"How does 34 CFR 668.4(e) relate to the recalculation of Pell Grant awards for students who graduate early from a clock-hour program, and what are the implications under 34 CFR 668.61?","['<1-hop>\n\nRecovery of Funds From Interim Disbursements 34 CFR 668.61', '<2-hop>\n\nenrollment intensity changes before the disbursement is made. If the student withdraws from all classes (or doesn9t begin attending any classes), you must follow the procedures discussed in Volume 5. Pell Recalculation Due to Change in COA When a student9s COA changes during the award year, and their enrollment intensity remains the same, you may (but are not required to) establish a policy under which you recalculate the student9s Pell Grant award. Once established, you must consistently apply such a recalculation policy to all students in the program. Tuition and Fee Charges and Recalculation If your school recalculates a student9s Pell Grant due to a change in enrollment intensity but continues to charge tuition and fees for credit hours that are no longer included in the student9s enrollment intensity for Pell Grant purposes, this does not affect the requirement to recalculate the student9s Pell Grant award. For example, if a student enrolls as a full-time student with 12 credits, but never starts attendance in a 3-credit class that starts after the school9s <add/drop= date, the student9s award must be recalculated based on 9 credits or 75% enrollment intensity. This is true, even though the school charges tuition for any classes dropped after the <add/ drop= date, and therefore continues to charge the student for 12 credits. Recalculation of Pell Grant Awards for Students Who Graduate Early From a Clock-Hour Program Under the regulations that govern the treatment of Title IV funds when a student withdraws, a student who completes all the requirements for graduation from a program before completing the days or hours they were scheduled to complete is not considered to have withdrawn, and no return of Title IV funds calculation is required (see Volume 5 for more detail). However, a school may be required to return a portion of the Pell Grant funds that were awarded to a student who successfully completes the requirements for graduation from a clock-hour program before completing the number of clock hours that they were scheduled to complete. Note that successfully completed clock hours may include a limited number of clock hours for which the student was granted an excused absence if your school has an excused absence policy that meets the requirements described in 34 CFR 668.4(e). For more information, see the discussion of ""Excused absences in clock-hour programs"" in Volume 3, Chapter 1. A student\'s eligibility to receive Title IV aid for a clock-hour program is based, in part, on the total number of clock hours in the program. If a school allows a student to graduate from a clock-hour program without completing all the originally established hours for the program, the school has effectively shortened the program length and reduced a student\'s Title IV aid eligibility for the program. In this circumstance, the school must recalculate the student\'s Pell Grant award based on the number of hours the student completed. The school must return to the Department the difference between the recalculated award amount and the Pell Grant amount that the student originally received. (For a student who received a Direct Loan, the school must also prorate the student\'s annual loan limit in this situation, or, if the loan limit was originally subject to proration, recalculate the original prorated loan limit. See Volume 8 for more information.)']","34 CFR 668.4(e) is relevant to the recalculation of Pell Grant awards for students who graduate early from a clock-hour program because it addresses the requirements for excused absences in such programs. If a student completes the graduation requirements before completing the scheduled clock hours, the school must recalculate the student's Pell Grant award based on the completed hours, including any excused absences that meet the requirements of 34 CFR 668.4(e). This recalculation is necessary because the school has effectively shortened the program length, thereby reducing the student's Title IV aid eligibility. Under 34 CFR 668.61, if a student withdraws or does not begin attending classes, the school must follow specific procedures for the recovery of funds from interim disbursements. This regulation ensures that any overpayment of Pell Grant funds is returned to the Department, maintaining compliance with federal student aid program requirements.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How do the cost of attendance calculations for correspondence study programs relate to the exceptions for loan periods when clinical work is included, as discussed in Chapter 1 and Chapter 3?","['<1-hop>\n\nThe cost of attendance (COA) for students engaged in a program of study by correspondence must include tuition and fees and, if required, books, course materials, supplies, and equipment. A school may also include an allowance for travel, housing, and food costs incurred specifically for a period of residential training. The COA must be based on the costs for a full-time student for a full academic year for the relevant component. If the student9s program or period of enrollment, as measured in credit hours, is longer or shorter than an academic year as measured in credit hours, the tuition and fees for the program or enrollment period must be prorated. Because the correspondence study COA for the nonresidential component only includes costs associated with credit hours, your school always uses the credit-hour-related fraction to prorate the COA. (Because there are no costs associated with weeks of instructional time in the correspondence cost of attendance, your school must prorate the cost only if the number of hours in the program is shorter or longer than in an academic year): Credit hours in program9s definition of an academic year ÷ Credit hours to which the costs apply The resulting amount is the full-time, full-academic-year cost used for calculating Pell Grant eligibility. Pell Enrollment Intensity for Correspondence Study Programs Students enrolled in programs of correspondence study are no more than half-time students (the equivalent of 50% enrollment intensity), even if they are enrolled in enough coursework to be full time. However, if the correspondence study is combined with regular coursework, the student9s enrollment intensity might be more than 50%. For a student enrolled in a term-based correspondence program, your school must determine how many credits to include in the numerator of the enrollment intensity formula to determine the student9s annual award. See the <Students taking a combination of regular and correspondence courses= section in Chapter 3 for additional guidance. A student enrolled only in a non-term correspondence program always has their award calculated based on 50% enrollment intensity. Pell Correspondence Payment Periods and Timing of Payments For a non-term correspondence program, there must be two equal payment periods in each academic year. Each payment period is the lesser of half the academic year or half the program (measured in credit hours). In addition, you can9t disburse a Pell payment for the first payment period until the student has completed 25% of the work in the academic year or the program, whichever is shorter. You can9t make the second payment until the student has completed 75% of the work in the academic year or program. For a term-based correspondence program, as for other term-based programs, the payment period is the term. However, you can9t disburse Pell for a payment period until the student has completed 50% of the lessons or completes 50% of the work for the term, whichever is later. If the correspondence program has a required period of residential training, you must treat the residential training as an additional payment period and determine the payment for that payment period using either Formula 3 or Formula 4. Note that the correspondence portion of the program is still treated as a separate portion of the program that9s divided into equal payment periods.', '<2-hop>\n\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term Volume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and nonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria to be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as discussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below. If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs. If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the starting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on August 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not begin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be the beginning date of the term. If the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a Direct Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the case). For example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring semesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the spring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as September 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term. If loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the normal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies, and the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of a fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that fall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1 through June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1 through June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for information on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits). If there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work, and the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to begin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two loan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.']","The cost of attendance (COA) for correspondence study programs includes tuition, fees, and potentially an allowance for travel, housing, and food costs during residential training. This COA is based on a full-time student for a full academic year and is prorated based on credit hours if the program length differs from an academic year. In contrast, Chapter 1 discusses exceptions to normal loan periods when clinical work is included in standard or nonstandard terms. If clinical work meets specific criteria, it can alter the start and end dates of loan periods, affecting the academic year period and payment periods. These exceptions ensure that the loan period aligns with the actual duration of the student's academic activities, including clinical work, which may extend beyond standard term dates.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How can a concerned parent in the U.S. navigate the credit history requirements for Direct PLUS Loans while ensuring their child's Cost of Attendance (COA) includes allowances for dependent care and disability-related expenses?,"['<1-hop>\n\nFor these students, the COA may include (at the option of the school) a food and housing allowance for up to three semesters or the equivalent, with no more than two semesters or the equivalent being consecutive at any one school. If a school chooses to include a food and housing allowance in the COA for less-than-half-time students, the allowance is based on the student9s living situation, as described above for students who are enrolled at least half-time. Dependent Care Costs For students with dependents, this allowance covers actual costs expected to be incurred for dependent care during periods that include but are not limited to class time, study time, field work, internships, and commuting time for the student. The amount of the allowance should be based on the number and age of the student9s dependents and should not exceed reasonable cost in the community for the type of care provided. Because students are often unaware of this allowance, schools should explain the availability of the dependent care allowance when counseling students and tell them how to request that an allowance for dependent care be included in their COA. See <Documentation of Exceptional Expenses= later in the chapter for guidance on documenting dependent care costs. Costs of Obtaining a License, Certification, or First Professional Credential For students enrolled in programs that require professional licensure, certification, or a first professional credential in order to practice or participate in the occupation the program is preparing the student to enter, the COA must include an allowance for the costs of obtaining the license, certification, or credential. Examples of allowable costs include fees charged to take a licensing exam, costs associated with applying for and obtaining the license or certification, and bar exam fees for law students pursuing a Juris Doctor (JD) degree. Under this provision, the costs must be incurred during (not after) a period of enrollment, even if the exam is after the end of the period. Schools may use either actual or average costs when determining the amount of this allowance. If a school chooses to use average costs, it must develop a reasonable basis for the average amount using the actual costs of a first professional credential that the school is aware of for the profession that a program prepares a student to enter. The allowance may include costs for multiple license or credential test attempts, though schools have discretion to set a reasonable limit on the number of attempts allowed to be included in a student9s COA. Costs for Study Abroad Programs For a student enrolled in a study abroad program approved for credit by the student9s home school, the COA includes reasonable costs associated with such study as determined by the home school. For example, the COA for a student who is a U.S. citizen studying at a foreign school may include visa/passport costs. Disability-Related Expenses For a student with a disability, the COA includes an allowance for expenses related to the student9s disability. Such expenses include special services, personal assistance, transportation, equipment, and supplies that are reasonably incurred and not provided by other agencies. A student is considered to have a disability if they have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, such as if the student is deaf, has a mental disability, is hard of hearing, has a speech or language impairment, is visually disabled, is seriously emotionally disturbed, orthopedically impaired, autistic, has a traumatic brain injury, is otherwise health-impaired, or has specific learning disabilities that require special education and related services. See <Documentation of Exceptional Expenses= later in the chapter for guidance on documenting disability-related expenses.', '<2-hop>\n\nposted to FSA9s Knowledge Center. Please stay tuned to the electronic announcement section in the Knowledge Center for the latest information. The tax return transcript may show a per computer amount for some tax data that is different from what the filer reported to the IRS. The per computer amount should be used because it corrects mathematical errors and is more accurate than what appears on the original return. Also, if a transcript indicates <recomputed <tax return item> per computer,= that amount may be ignored for verification. Schools may accept for verification any IRS tax transcript that includes all the necessary information: adjusted gross income, income earned from work, U.S. income tax paid, untaxed IRA distributions, untaxed pensions, education credits, IRA deductions, tax exempt interest, and foreign income exempt from federal taxation. Because the <record of account transcript= and the <tax return transcript= include all the above information, either may be used for verification. The <wage and income transcript= only provides wage information and therefore can only be used in lieu of a W-2 form. Filers of non-IRS tax returns. You may accept a transcript from a government of a foreign nation or a U.S. territory or commonwealth that has all the filer9s income and tax data to be verified. You may also accept a copy of the tax return, which must be signed by the filer or one of the filers of a joint return. Use the income and tax data that most closely corresponds to what is on the IRS tax return and convert monetary amounts into U.S. dollars as appropriate. If you question the accuracy of the information on the signed copy of the return, the filer must provide you with a copy of the tax account information issued by the tax authority. See DOC-Q28 on the Program Integrity Questions and Answers 3 Verification. Unique Situations and Exceptions Joint Return Filers Who Are No Longer Married When a student, or parents of a dependent student, filed a joint return and have separated, divorced, married someone else, or been widowed, the student must submit the following: A transcript obtained from the IRS or other relevant tax authority that lists 2023 tax account information of the tax filer(s); or A copy of the income tax return and the applicable schedules that were filed with the IRS or other relevant tax authority that lists 2023 tax account information of the tax filer(s); and A copy of IRS Form W-2 for each source of 2023 employment income received or an equivalent document. Using a Joint Return to Figure Individual AGI and Taxes Paid If the filer of a joint return has become widowed, divorced, or separated since filing the return, it may be necessary to determine the individual9s income and taxes paid using the joint return and W-2 forms. If a W-2 is not available (the filer is self-employed, for example) or if a duplicate copy from the employer who issued the original W-2 is not available in a timely manner, the school may permit the filer to provide a signed statement that certifies the base year AGI and U.S. taxes paid. Add the income amounts from the individual9s W-2 forms to any other income that can be extracted from the joint return. Any interest or business income earned on joint accounts or investments should be assessed at 50%. The same procedure should be used to divide business or farm profits or losses. Also, if the AGI listed on the joint return was adjusted, you should reduce the individual9s AGI by the portion of the adjustment that applies solely to individual on the FAFSA form.']","A concerned parent in the U.S. looking to support their child's higher education through Direct PLUS Loans must first understand the credit history requirements, which typically involve a credit check to ensure the borrower does not have an adverse credit history. To ensure their child's Cost of Attendance (COA) includes necessary allowances, the parent should work with the school to include dependent care costs, which cover actual costs expected for dependents during class and study times, and disability-related expenses, which cover special services and equipment for students with disabilities. Schools should provide guidance on how to document these exceptional expenses and include them in the COA, ensuring the financial needs related to dependent care and disabilities are met.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
